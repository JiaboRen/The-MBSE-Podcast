00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:05,872
Hello and welcome
Here for MBSE Podcast

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:12,378
Today we want to shortly explain

3
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,960
what we do here
and why we do it

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,456
Let me introduce myself

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,180
My name is Christian

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,990
I am a product manager
and consultant and team leader

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,117
for the team "Engineering Transformation"
at CONTACT Software

8
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:33,446
and I am an active member of INCOSE

9
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:40,230
Since 2015 I have joined the
OMG technical meetings

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,780
because I joined it from the beginning

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,595
because I join the SysML 2 standard
engineering activity

12
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:51,751
Since September 2008 I am under
other co-chair of the ManTIS DTF

13
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,590
that is

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,276
"Manufacturing Technology and
Information Systems Domain Task Force"

15
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,703
And who are you?

16
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:02,830
Hello, my name is Tim

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,420
I am a consultant trainer
and board member at oose

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,696
I am also a book author
editor, lecturer

19
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:12,960
And I am also an active
member of OMG and INCOSE

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,354
At OMG for a long time and currently

21
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:18,608
I'll follow up with it

22
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:22,660
And Airbus, the working group
I'm working on SysML 1

23
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,895
And I'm also working on
a team on SysML 2

24
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,840
What are we doing here?

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,746
We do MBSE Podcast

26
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:31,089
And the idea is

27
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,906
that we don't do another
explanatory video

28
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,645
and also books and articles

29
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,306
What is there
enough about MBSE?

30
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,367
Are there still any good
ways to contribute?

31
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:44,340
The idea is actually to bring out
the stories between the lines

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,489
which people also experience
at conferences during the breaks

33
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,840
or at the systems engineering
round table

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,406
We all want to do
that in this podcast

35
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:56,431
And we plan to invite guest
speakers here every time

36
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:58,324
who help us

37
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:00,603
What are the topics
of the podcast?

38
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,332
We have already considered it

39
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,597
You have already mentioned one topic

40
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:07,939
We will let our guest speakers play

41
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:12,042
We will also interview one
or the other exciting actors

42
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:14,030
I think we spontaneously invite guests

43
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,210
like Sandy Friedenthal or
Richard Soley or so

44
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,883
Of course, it is not limited

45
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:24,678
Many other organizations as well

46
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,288
Current events from the MBSE

47
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:29,240
when something new comes from INCOSE

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,420
Or something exciting
happens at GfSE

49
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,190
we want to talk about that

50
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,970
And of course very clearly

51
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:43,479
because we are very
close with the SysML

52
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,754
But do you actually
run such a podcast now?

53
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:49,220
That gives modeling

54
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,019
We have to show something

55
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,510
And we just show them
what it is also a video podcast

56
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,580
We are simply going to chat

57
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,860
And we simply publish the audio
track as an audio podcast

58
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,739
Most of the sessions
will be live stream

59
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:06,289
that is, the posts are then uncut

60
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:09,960
They are what they are
Authentic

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,157
We will start posts in German

62
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:14,840
We are both German native speakers

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,330
It is easier for us to start this way

64
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,697
But there are plenty of
exciting English guest speakers

65
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:23,195
And then we do this in English as well

66
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:26,142
Whether we will do in
German or English in the future

67
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:28,793
Let me consider it

68
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,193
For the future
A good keyword

69
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:31,990
How often do we do it?

70
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:34,640
That is an exciting question

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,143
because we both do it in our free time

72
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:41,622
We decided a very rough goal

73
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,980
We will release an episode
once a month

74
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,136
Maybe two
Maybe none

75
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:48,795
It depends on how we find time

76
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,896
and how the whole thing goes
down with you as a listener

77
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,497
if you show a lot of interest there

78
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:59,770
Probably it can be more often

79
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,230
But how can you follow us?

80
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,080
How can you catch the information
of any podcast episodes?

81
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,923
It is in the YouTube channel

82
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:11,802
You can subscribe to it
You can always get the information

83
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:15,361
You can subscribe to
the various podcast sources

84
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:18,733
And you can find all the information
about it on our website

85
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:22,389
http://mbse-podcast.rocks

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,177
Exactly

87
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:24,954
Right

88
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:28,175
So, how is that for today?

89
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:31,308
We just wanted to briefly announce
the whole thing to you

90
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:33,972
We wanted to introduce ourselves to you

91
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:37,810
And next time we have already
chosen a very exciting topic

92
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,580
we want to work up
the history of SysML

93
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:51,674
Tim can tell a lot because

94
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:54,767
Tim, how long have you worked for it?
Since the SysML 1.?

95
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,640
SysML 1.0

96
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,679
Because it started in 2003

97
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:02,899
Excellent!

98
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:07,096
That's all the better
It wasn't so clear to me at all

99
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,070
What learned

100
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,340
What learned again

101
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,230
Okay

102
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,690
We would like to do it if possible

103
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:21,131
on November 5th at 7 p.m.
live with you on YouTube

104
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:27,240
We would be very happy
about your participation

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,746
And we have still something to say

106
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:34,139
I remember it

107
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,919
"Trust us. We are System Engineers"
