00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,440
mbse podcast

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,920
like many others we had a little summer

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,320
break but now we are back

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,200
the swiss conference will take place

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
next month september the 6th in zurich

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
in switzerland of course

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
and we take this as an opportunity to

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,680
talk a little bit about the conference

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,880
of the local swiss in cozy chapter and

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,160
our guest is professor marco di mao who

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,480
is one of the organizers of the

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,719
conference and welcome marco and please

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
introduce yourself hello

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
um

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,280
thanks tim and christian for inviting me

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,480
to this podcast first time on this show

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,840
so to say

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,280
and

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,039
think about myself so i'm currently

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,039
professor of systems engineering at

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,000
ingles start university

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,960
and

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,160
i live in switzerland which is why i'm

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,520
part of this

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,640
amazing event this we said 21

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,559
and i also work for the swiss chapter so

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
you know that that's the connection to

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,240
today's podcast before i became

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,119
professor i ran my own consultancy for

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,280
systems engineering for huge projects

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,400
mainly fusion research nuclear fusion

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,240
research so

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,720
the biggest experiments in the world

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,040
currently uh run and the

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,159
the nicest one is but it's it's probably

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,600
not the nicest project but it's

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,439
definitely the nicest location it's in

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,680
the south of france where i worked for

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,560
six years and after that in oxford for

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
the successor of eta which you probably

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
have heard

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,520
and yes i've i've been involved in in

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,520
cozy for about 10 years now so i know

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,840
tim and christian because i was member

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,000
of the german chapter for quite a while

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,560
and as i said i now live in switzerland

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,479
so i'm now a member of the swiss chapter

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,520
and also member of the organizing

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
committee for all sorts of things

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,320
all right thank you for your

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,040
introduction

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
yeah it's a pleasure to have you with us

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,320
um

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,799
and i guess many of our

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,360
podcast listeners will see that we have

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,759
again quite a new

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,640
series like uh mbse events

59
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,879
and so we are talking about swiss today

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
and swiss is

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,760
swiss ad

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
like i learned before

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,120
swiss ad is a systems engineering

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,200
conference but what does it stand for

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
so as we said um yeah it's it's a

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,040
mangled word like a portmanteau so

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,200
basically there's swiss in there you

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,360
know obviously it's the swiss

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,840
and then we have the systems engineering

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,080
day is said so it's you know kind of a

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,480
mix but basically it's a swiss

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,080
systems engineering day so it's one day

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,680
every year where the whole of

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
switzerland plus

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,760
friends and

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,040
family sort of say long-standing friends

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,599
come together to um lake zurich where we

78
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,040
hold it and have an i have a really nice

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,720
day where we talk about systems

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,840
engineering and have lots of very

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,840
interesting keynotes and presentations

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,200
and uh who's the organization behind

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,760
swiss

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,120
so uh the organization behind the swiss

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
ed is the system the oh sorry yeah we

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
didn't call it swiss because you've been

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
switched um

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,400
so

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,920
we call the swiss chapter of in cozy

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,879
it's called ssse which stands for um

91
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,840
the swiss society of systems engineering

92
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
and

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
um yes

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
we run it

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,360
as a bit like the tdse in germany you

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,040
know it's our flagship event

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,200
every year

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,599
so this edge should also be written with

99
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,319
3s right because this is systems

100
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,840
engineering and maybe it's free

101
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,280
it should be that's that's why i say

102
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,040
it's like uh

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,680
and an acronym

104
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,760
i don't know what the actual grammatics

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,959
you know the term for it is but yes it

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,280
should be swiss sed

107
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,080
um but maybe it's like in german where

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,480
you can't do the three s in in one word

109
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,120
unless there's a t after the third one

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,760
or something remember your weird

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
grammar rules in germany

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,400
how do you spell the abbreviation for

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,439
the chapter this is

114
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,799
s-s-s-e-r yes

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,360
c-c

116
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
see

117
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,400
i think we say ssse yeah this is z

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
okay that was one s too much

119
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,360
it's three s n e so triple s e we should

120
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,440
call it right like i triple e yeah

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
triple s plus e

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,919
that's actually that you know and then

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,680
we could make up ideas of what the three

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,280
s e's you know it could be three s e

125
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,840
then

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
uh i'll put it i'll put it in the you

127
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
know for the

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,199
um to discuss it when we actually

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
committing

130
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,199
all right the agenda

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,120
yeah so

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,320
how do you organize this conference the

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,479
swiss ad

134
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,720
do you have a professional agency or

135
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
just by volunteers

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
um

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,320
actually no we do it it's all voluntary

138
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,360
work so it's it's as i said we have this

139
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,240
committee

140
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,440
and we're between six and ten people who

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,120
run the ssse and we also organize this

142
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
with it as i say it's our flagship so

143
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
it's it's

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
um

145
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
yeah

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
it is actually the event that draws in

147
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,560
people so it's a bit like a marketing

148
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,280
thing as well as our

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
focus event where we you know talk about

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,880
new ideas and systems engineering and

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,639
all that so

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,039
all the volunteers who do it really like

153
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,880
to work for it because yes it's it's

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,440
quite a bit of work but it's also you

155
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,759
have you get to know a lot of people a

156
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,440
lot of players internationally so some

157
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,639
of our sponsors for example come from

158
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
australia

159
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,120
why ever but um

160
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
so it's a lot of fun to do it plus we

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,080
meet regularly and

162
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,479
okay now with covet we meet remote but

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,880
not all of us because um some people

164
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,960
work in the same company so they use one

165
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,440
of the offices and then we have a video

166
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,199
conferencing with them um you know where

167
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,840
we are remote and then they're there

168
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,000
drinking beer bastards and now it's a

169
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,919
lot of fun so we do it as the swiss

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,919
chapter but it's it's like a circle of

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,919
friends organizing a party basically

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
a bit more professional sorry i don't

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,440
want to give you the wrong impressions

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,319
but

175
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,680
yeah it's very professional

176
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,960
yeah but to be at the party it cost

177
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
money so

178
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,440
as a participant i have to of course pay

179
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,600
a registration fee uh do you know how

180
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,759
much is it and is there a discount for

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,960
the cosy members

182
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,759
yeah so hey

183
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,840
it's you don't really pay money it's

184
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,600
it's like it's a small fee compared to

185
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,759
other conferences definitely i think

186
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
it's about 100 francs or 120 or

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,680
something it's not not that much and

188
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,000
then there is a discount definitely for

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,080
uh in cozy members i'm i'm

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,599
i'm not the secretary of the

191
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,000
i don't know the actual price but you

192
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,440
can find them on the registration site

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,360
but it's it's definitely um

194
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,000
i wouldn't even call it a fee because

195
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,080
you get a lot for it it's it's basically

196
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,759
the entrance to a really nice venue i

197
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,560
don't know i think we might talk about

198
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,199
the venue later but um the venue is on

199
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,960
lake zurich it's the casino of zurich

200
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,400
and so it's an amazing venue with a

201
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,680
really nice view

202
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,680
and we have i think you might want to

203
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,599
correct me but i've been to lots of

204
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,560
systems engineering conferences all over

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,599
the world

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,840
and i think we have the best catering

207
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,800
so you get a really nice lunch buffet

208
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,960
and

209
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,120
we haven't we always have an upper row

210
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,720
and you can then have it on the terrace

211
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,479
right basically sitting on a balcony

212
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,759
overlooking lake zurich

213
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,960
and good wine and and even even good

214
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,960
beer and always good weather so

215
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,560
almost everything's crossed this year

216
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,479
right

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,120
we haven't had a summer in switzerland

218
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,280
and with lots of hail so yeah fingers

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
crossed but yes it's normally a really

220
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,680
nice thing

221
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
okay

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,080
so

223
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,360
the swiss chapter is quite young but you

224
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,240
already have quite a history in swiss ad

225
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,360
so when was it held the first time

226
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,479
so the first swiss ad was the same year

227
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,039
when the swiss chapter was founded 2014.

228
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,720
so this is the eighth edition of it

229
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,199
coming up and

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
yes we've we've held it every year even

231
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,160
last year with the

232
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
say the more

233
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,919
although in september it was it eased a

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,440
lot so we we held it as a hybrid

235
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,039
conference as we will

236
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,360
this year so

237
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,240
we haven't lapsed yet eight years in a

238
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
row

239
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,200
and we've yeah it's it's been a very

240
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,279
varied conference with lots of nice

241
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
contributions from

242
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,760
you know

243
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,800
a nice

244
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,320
say a cross-section of the people that

245
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,040
you would expect at a systems

246
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,200
engineering conference

247
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,519
yeah i remember last year that was

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,839
great was my only in-person event last

249
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,519
year so in the second half last year

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,080
it was very surprising it was very

251
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,279
strange to travel again to to meet

252
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,160
people

253
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,600
yes and we had we had two in two or

254
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
three weeks within two or three weeks we

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
had the

256
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,200
uh requirements engineering conference

257
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,360
the ieee one that was in zurich and that

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,160
was also an in-person event

259
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,720
at the university and then um suicide

260
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
yes so hybrid event but we i mean you

261
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,920
were there tim and christine you were

262
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,160
there as well right so

263
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,160
no last year no i skipped last year you

264
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,920
skipped this i always see your face when

265
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,240
i come in like that

266
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,760
it's like the first person you see as we

267
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,600
said sorry

268
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,279
um yes but

269
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,279
so so we had it in a

270
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,120
nice personal event

271
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,560
and um

272
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,640
it's it's as i say the the content is is

273
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
really varied and it's

274
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,160
probably less than 60 percent of swiss

275
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,320
contributors yeah it's probably less

276
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,680
than 50 even service contributions so we

277
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
get them from all over the world

278
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,080
speakers

279
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,920
who were the speakers so in the past can

280
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
you name a few of them

281
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,440
yes we had

282
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,560
a lot of the high caliber ones

283
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,120
so the the keynotes alone is like the um

284
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,519
who's who of systems engineering so we

285
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,440
had olivier divek who runs the systems

286
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
engineering class at mit

287
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
we had larry liefer who's

288
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,880
kind of the he's not the inventor of

289
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,440
design thinking but he's definitely one

290
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,560
of the icons of design thinking in

291
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,680
stanford university we have dave snowden

292
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,680
who invented the kinevic um or kinevin

293
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
framework

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,640
um for you know

295
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,640
what is it uh

296
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,680
complexity yes so it's

297
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,279
i couldn't remember i think it's he's

298
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,399
got different names but it's roughly

299
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,880
it's simple

300
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,399
it's com um complicated complex and

301
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,320
chaotic and then you have this really

302
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,560
nice fault in the middle so where you

303
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,480
can basically go

304
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,000
jump into chaos from from any of the

305
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,440
four so um that was one of the like the

306
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,040
keynotes that stand out in my head

307
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,279
because it was the first time i saw dave

308
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,440
and then i immediately booked his class

309
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,839
he came to i think he stayed in zurich i

310
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,839
think it was two weeks later so

311
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,000
and we had yourself tim

312
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,600
you're not only a regular contributor

313
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
but also we had yet

314
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
as a keynote

315
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,360
and david long you know everybody who

316
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,880
knows in cozy knows probably david long

317
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
from tech

318
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,200
and john holt you know i don't know was

319
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,640
it last time you had him on the on the

320
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,040
podcast but you definitely had him on

321
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,480
your plate yes

322
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,000
after that germany lost against uk

323
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,519
in the

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,519
soccer championship as they should

325
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,200
the man with the

326
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,800
or was it his

327
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,680
for everyone who doesn't know john so

328
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,399
he's the magician systems engineer

329
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
and

330
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,800
so he's got this black hat and he's

331
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,720
always dressed in black and then he

332
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,360
always claims to give a presentation in

333
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,360
one slide but it's heavily animated

334
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,639
yeah it's a lot of good fun um last year

335
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,560
we also had michael lyric

336
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,200
he's also one of the design thinkers

337
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,600
yeah so it's a really nice

338
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,600
selection

339
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,399
how do we get all these people so how do

340
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,880
you get in contact with larry life oh

341
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,200
well they they direct us they contact us

342
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,200
no no

343
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
no

344
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,399
i think i think

345
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,040
and this i think it's also the same when

346
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,600
i was in gfc it kind of is all about

347
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,160
networking and then these contexts just

348
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,760
emerge in a way so it's like an emergent

349
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,440
behavior like in systems engineering

350
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,079
anyway so um i know that mike johnson

351
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,160
who's a household name in the swiss um

352
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,120
chapter not only but you know everybody

353
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
who knows

354
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,800
about or is interested in systems

355
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,760
engineering switzerland would know um

356
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,480
michael mike johnson and he contributed

357
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,279
to the design thinking playbook

358
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,480
which is the the famous one by larry and

359
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,000
michael

360
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,600
and so i'm guessing that that was you

361
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,639
know where this connection came from

362
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
olivier

363
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,320
also he is not only at mit but he's also

364
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,440
the class runs at mit and epfl at the

365
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,440
same time so epfl is in lausanne right

366
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,480
so that is also swiss connection and i

367
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,680
think he's actually from eth zurich so

368
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,839
you know that's all like um dave

369
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,959
and mike work together so that's where

370
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,360
dave snowden probably came from

371
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,720
well tim we all know you so

372
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,760
um

373
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,680
yes and and david long is is also one uh

374
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,240
one of the people who who likes to come

375
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,480
to europe europe and help us

376
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,279
presenting stuff and john obviously he's

377
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,279
you know he's everywhere

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,639
right

379
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,040
yeah so you already told us about the

380
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,800
venue which i can confirm which is

381
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,600
really nice and

382
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
uh

383
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,279
so if if somebody

384
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,760
chooses to be part of of swissette

385
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,440
what can you expect how how does the

386
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,560
work the conference

387
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,639
that works conference day

388
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,880
well i think i already hinted at it so

389
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,639
it is and and it has been before i moved

390
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,800
to switzerland it is my favorite systems

391
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,839
engineering conference because a it's

392
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,480
not

393
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,040
it's not as stiff as any of the ieee

394
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,160
ones so it's not about publication it's

395
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,639
not about

396
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,600
being seen and you know showing off and

397
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,279
ooh look at what i my research so it's

398
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,839
less presenting research it's more

399
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,760
presenting experience and talk about it

400
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,240
so it's it's a really relaxed atmosphere

401
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,320
i think that's my main point and then

402
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,600
because it's so relaxed and because the

403
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
catering is so nice and most people

404
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,920
drink wine at lunch

405
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,079
um everybody's really approachable so as

406
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,199
i said you know i met dave well i saw

407
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,079
dave in that

408
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,920
keynote he gave dave snowden and then i

409
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,360
just talked to him and he told me oh i'm

410
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
giving this class if you want to come

411
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,160
you know

412
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,240
join us so

413
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,040
it's it's really nice you meet all these

414
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,600
people that you've heard of or seen

415
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,160
youtube videos off or you know read

416
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,240
papers by and and they're there and you

417
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,480
can just talk to them and everybody is

418
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,120
approachable and really enjoys being

419
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,040
approached and then the lunch break is

420
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,079
considerable i think is it an hour and a

421
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,959
half or an hour it's definitely an hour

422
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,360
and then you sit on the balcony and and

423
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,639
you know that the people walk around and

424
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,120
change tables and so you can talk to to

425
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,800
a lot of people and a nice cross-section

426
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,480
of industries

427
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,320
um obviously this being switzerland we

428
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,800
have a lot of med tech and you know

429
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,560
emerging industries for systems

430
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
engineering

431
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,839
and they they all of them have

432
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,720
interesting stories to tell so it's

433
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,959
that's really nice and afterwards we

434
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,959
have this upper row which i

435
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,720
i know we have it at conferences that

436
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,320
run over two days or something you know

437
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,240
we have this icebreaker maybe uh but but

438
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,560
there it's just the the people who don't

439
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,880
want to leave don't leave they stay

440
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,320
there and we we you know we have some

441
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,800
drinks and we talk more and i

442
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,680
i think i normally stay until the last

443
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
train home

444
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,440
yeah because you know

445
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,279
you ask some people you want to join us

446
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,920
for dinner and then we have a dinner

447
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,279
downstairs there's a restaurant and

448
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,079
who wants to stay

449
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,959
stays and then yeah we we eat something

450
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,800
and talk

451
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,800
even more about systems engineering but

452
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,519
this is mostly about anecdotes from you

453
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,519
know

454
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,440
from system other system engineering

455
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,360
events so that's it yeah absolutely it's

456
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,600
really nice maybe i should change my

457
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,600
travel plan so i always have to leave in

458
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,680
the evening that at six or seven to

459
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,800
catch the last plane back

460
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,199
so

461
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,079
i have a nice sofas tim yeah i need to

462
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,160
stay and jose is not paying for it

463
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,880
i just wanted to say it's just because

464
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,959
in zurich the hotels are the prices are

465
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,160
enormous

466
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,399
and that's the other thing right

467
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,959
everything is extortionately expensive

468
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,199
in switzerland but as we said isn't

469
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,720
yeah so for the price of the suicide you

470
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,720
get three yogurts in the supermarket

471
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,199
it's not a commercial conference right

472
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,240
it's uh you must cover the costs and

473
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,360
yeah

474
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,679
yes so so we we have sponsors

475
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,280
and obviously we're very grateful to all

476
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,120
the sponsors that we have because

477
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,880
without them we couldn't run it

478
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,480
and they also come as i said they come

479
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,240
from all over the place

480
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,160
and also from from different their

481
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,120
different industries we have kind of

482
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,440
everything

483
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,600
there and the sponsors obviously they

484
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,360
get they get nice visibility so if

485
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,360
anybody out there wants to become our

486
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,640
sponsor this year you know silver

487
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,799
sponsorship only costs a thousand francs

488
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,799
um which is hardly anything in euros

489
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,080
probably a thousand euros now but um

490
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,240
yes so you got really nice visibility

491
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
there and and obviously entrance for

492
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,880
some of your people

493
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,880
covered okay

494
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,400
yeah you already mentioned that

495
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,919
uh it's in

496
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,840
zurich at the lake and it's possible to

497
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,720
um join

498
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,280
it virtually again yes how does it work

499
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,480
so how can i join a an in-person

500
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,039
conference virtually

501
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,120
we stream all the presentations so you

502
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,799
you have we have three streams and you

503
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
can basically just

504
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,240
log on to the stream and and follow it

505
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,960
but they

506
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,360
everybody remote can also ask questions

507
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,280
um so they will be either unmuted or um

508
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,960
the questions i can't remember how we

509
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,840
did it actually i think some of the

510
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,400
questions were then relayed by a person

511
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,919
at the conference and asked

512
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
well that worked really well last time

513
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,799
so

514
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
i thought the virtual participants were

515
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,600
even more awake than they didn't have

516
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,600
the wine at lunch right

517
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,120
right

518
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,360
yeah so

519
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,080
maybe some of our listeners are

520
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,799
wondering their selves that

521
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,520
why are you talking about a

522
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,360
swiss engineering conference um and i

523
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,080
think the the answer is that your

524
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,720
conference language is english but why

525
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,600
is a swiss as with

526
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,360
engineering day in english

527
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,280
um

528
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,400
many reasons a as you know switzerland

529
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,120
has four official languages right

530
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,840
so

531
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,840
there isn't the one although it's always

532
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,200
in zurich or always has been in zurich

533
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,960
at least

534
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,160
which is the german-speaking part of

535
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,679
switzerland

536
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,679
you could say it could be also a

537
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,559
german-speaking conference but

538
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
the

539
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,400
um

540
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,080
the atmosphere zurich is very

541
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,960
international place as you all know then

542
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,200
as i say we have french italian and i

543
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,400
don't know how we say it in english

544
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,520
so there's another language in

545
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
switzerland

546
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,160
um

547
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,080
they're the official languages so

548
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,799
picking one would be wrong you know it's

549
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,960
it's

550
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,520
so picking two french and german also

551
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,480
the italians wouldn't find that funny so

552
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,320
um english is like the uh

553
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,640
yeah the compromise but it's it's more

554
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,480
than that because also all our chapter

555
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,520
work although most of us are german

556
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,360
speakers we we speak english and i think

557
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,760
systems engineering you know lends

558
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,120
itself to speaking in or to discussing

559
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,360
it in english so

560
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,200
a lot of the terms are are

561
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,960
only known in english only exist only

562
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
makes sense in english and then in the

563
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,000
other languages you might have some

564
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
false friends you know so people don't

565
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
understand and you know one of the main

566
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,799
things you have to get right in systems

567
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,280
engineering is your glossary everybody

568
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,240
has to use the same terms with the same

569
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,960
meaning

570
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,120
and that's easier in english so

571
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,200
yes we we speak english at all our

572
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,039
committee meetings so the one we had on

573
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,039
tuesday i think we were only german

574
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,799
speakers native germans and we still

575
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,120
discussed it in english because then you

576
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,240
write them well you write the minutes

577
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,000
you know if you want to write the

578
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,000
minutes of that and then other people we

579
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,280
also have italians we have english

580
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,360
people on the

581
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,720
on the committee um you know then then

582
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,799
you know we then have to translate

583
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,120
everything so it's easier to talk

584
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
english

585
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,760
yeah um

586
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,360
well it's in three weeks or so now right

587
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,000
yeah yeah and

588
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,960
they cannot speak us this year now so

589
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,440
who are the keynote speakers yeah oh um

590
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,120
we have lars from daisy last

591
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,919
yeah if you don't know him

592
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,760
so i've i've heard him talk

593
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,919
i don't know how many years ago but he's

594
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,120
already he's been invited back then to

595
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,360
the fusion community and he's yeah he's

596
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,760
he's a wizard on on very in in various

597
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,840
fields and on various topics and he's

598
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,159
going to talk about plm-driven systems

599
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,320
engineering as a service

600
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,880
which you know i'm really much looking

601
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,880
forward to because um as

602
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,799
tim and chris you know i'm half of my

603
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,360
brain is also talking about

604
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,799
organizing information in systems

605
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,960
engineering so i'm really looking

606
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,720
forward to that one and the other one is

607
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,120
also really well known

608
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,880
definitely in the swiss chapter so

609
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,360
alessandro goldka

610
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,120
he's currently working at scaltech in

611
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,320
moscow

612
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,360
and he's going to talk about

613
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,280
accelerating product development um

614
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,120
he's already asking the question it's

615
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,720
the v model still

616
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,799
the answer i think it's called or still

617
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
up you know is it still

618
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,559
um up to date or

619
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,360
yeah topical

620
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,440
so

621
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,520
that's going to be more you know the

622
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,760
theoretical i'm guessing but then

623
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,240
knowing him and knowing skull tech um

624
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,480
you know it's probably still very

625
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,640
interesting for all us practitioners as

626
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,280
well so yeah i'm really looking forward

627
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,280
to those too

628
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,320
yeah um

629
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,320
i already had a look in

630
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,280
the agenda and

631
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,480
i saw a very interesting thing you have

632
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,120
a

633
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,720
track called climate and

634
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,120
you tim and marco you have to get also

635
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,799
one session in it so that sounds very

636
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,400
interesting to me to apply systems

637
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,880
engineering to

638
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,480
the climate change and uh

639
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,480
what what can you expect from that

640
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
so

641
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,640
the the basic idea is that both tim and

642
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:12,159
i independently from one another we both

643
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,840
got engaged in you know

644
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,880
not tackling climate change because

645
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,080
obviously that takes a lot but um just

646
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,200
getting getting to start um being part

647
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,960
of a movement or trying to help with our

648
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
or bringing our expertise to the various

649
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,720
problems and when you think about

650
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
climate change it's it's a very complex

651
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,000
problem

652
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,880
you have obviously the complexity of

653
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,440
weather

654
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,200
or climate right so obviously they're

655
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,520
not the same but it is a complex system

656
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,440
on many levels you have the

657
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,480
system that is the earth and its

658
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,320
atmosphere which is another system or

659
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,480
def you know definitely closely linked

660
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,679
with all these pockets of for example

661
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,840
carbon on earth somewhere hidden some

662
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,039
are melting now so it's it's very

663
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,159
complex um the time aspecting this so

664
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,799
the behavior changes all the time and

665
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,960
all of the problem definitions that you

666
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,799
read as a systems engineer you would

667
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,480
always go oh that's that's a problem

668
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,159
that we would love as systems engineers

669
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,799
that's really our um you know our

670
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,720
realm where we we discuss things

671
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,279
so that's one thing but you also have

672
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,600
the all the social aspects

673
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,600
you know why are there some still some

674
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,320
climate deniers and and how can you

675
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,559
convince them so that's also complex to

676
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,640
understand how you can tackle it on on

677
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,559
this level because you need

678
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,640
like the whole world to come together

679
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,960
and then last not least you have all

680
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,200
these models that try to predict what is

681
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,320
going to happen and then modeling is is

682
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,640
a big part of tim tim's and my work

683
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,159
we love modeling mbse and um

684
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,200
bringing all these things together and

685
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,000
and just discuss it and try to

686
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,279
ignite the systems engineering community

687
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,120
and say look

688
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,760
we can be

689
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,720
if not key but we can definitely

690
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,640
be

691
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,279
an important contribution or make an

692
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,600
important contribution towards tackling

693
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,080
climate change i think that's that's

694
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,159
how the idea was born and

695
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,880
that will be three presentations and a

696
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,200
workshop on climate or related

697
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,520
topics um and yeah it's the first time

698
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,159
we do this in any systems engineering

699
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,480
conference as far as i know

700
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,400
and we hope it catches on and then

701
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,440
that's the systems engineer

702
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,480
engineering community as a whole um gets

703
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,360
engaged and helps the world to tackle

704
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,880
this this amazing problem

705
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,480
yeah that sounds

706
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,720
really interesting

707
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
i think it was 10 years ago or so when

708
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,520
the encloses symposium was in the

709
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,120
netherlands um they called

710
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,440
it's a systems engineering for the

711
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,880
planet and so the mission of this

712
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,840
conference and

713
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,880
um

714
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,799
that was very inspiring so it was

715
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
it was great and it was one of the first

716
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,400
conferences or in cozy conferences i i

717
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,000
was and uh yeah so

718
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,480
we could definitely do something to

719
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,080
tackle systems uh the climate change so

720
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,440
the assistant engineering discipline is

721
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,440
perfect for that

722
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,159
as well as systems thinking and speaking

723
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,919
of

724
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,679
playbooks there's a playbook the

725
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,919
system's thinking playbook i think

726
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,840
that's the name playbook's

727
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,960
famous name for books but there's also a

728
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,679
book

729
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,320
the systems thinking playbook for

730
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,640
uh climate change or so

731
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,279
yeah there you learn

732
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,320
yeah systems thinking patterns methods

733
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,840
how to apply them to climate change

734
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,520
to better understand the climate change

735
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,520
all right you have to send me the link

736
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,120
it sounds really interesting but we will

737
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,840
do an exercise from this playbook on the

738
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,679
conference oh yeah

739
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,760
sure

740
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,640
great yeah we can we can look it up and

741
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:56,080
maybe we can link it in the show notes

742
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,080
yeah i have it here somewhere

743
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,039
i don't know

744
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,480
somewhere

745
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,480
too many books on my desktop

746
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,159
i i know that

747
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,400
too many books to read um yeah and i i

748
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,960
recently saw that we have a comment a

749
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,360
live comment here from stephan holt who

750
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,520
makes a great suggestion um he says why

751
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,080
not extending the conference

752
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,600
by something like a bar camp or with

753
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,600
open spaces on the next day

754
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,320
very good idea so what we do have not

755
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,600
this year but we used to have like a

756
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,679
world cafe

757
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,440
which is a bit like that we know we can

758
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,919
discuss ideas

759
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,080
um but extending the conference i think

760
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,600
we like to keep it to the one day but

761
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,520
obviously we wouldn't mind any

762
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,360
satellites so if anybody wanted to

763
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,679
organize a satellite conference

764
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,279
and and just you know it happens to be

765
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,679
the day after

766
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,279
that that would be great so stefan come

767
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,520
forward do it

768
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,159
you can sleep on my couch

769
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,159
how many cultures do you have still the

770
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,279
one tim and stefan i'm sure you don't

771
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,279
mind sharing yes

772
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,600
and then we do an mbs emac camera also

773
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,640
the next day

774
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,919
sure

775
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,480
next year

776
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,480
next year

777
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,679
um

778
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,799
okay so

779
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,320
well

780
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,360
what else do you do

781
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,399
besides

782
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,919
swiss organizations

783
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,960
um

784
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,640
what else do i do so so um i'm a father

785
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,520
of four year olds so i'm trying to teach

786
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
them

787
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,720
all

788
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,279
all the technology things um so that

789
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,840
they can take over at some point because

790
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,840
um you know i'm not as young as i sound

791
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,720
um

792
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,120
as a professor i'm i'm teaching systems

793
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,559
engineering and i also run some projects

794
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,960
with the students

795
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,720
and i always use systems engineering for

796
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,679
the project and

797
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,559
i try to link them to some some real

798
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,080
problems in the world that are better

799
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,840
approached with systems engineering so

800
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,880
it's either climate change so this

801
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,360
semester we worked on offshore wind with

802
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,919
a uk startup who put the

803
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,720
um the blades of the turbine basically

804
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,399
on

805
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,600
on the c so they're not standing up

806
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,360
they're like

807
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,720
the the axis is vertical rather than

808
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,480
horizontal so that was really

809
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,360
interesting and

810
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,600
i always try to learn when i teach so

811
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,760
this is kind of my approach and the

812
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,679
other thing we do a lot or i do i'm

813
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,080
involved in a lot is working with

814
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,000
charities in africa

815
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,320
who um

816
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,960
do mobility devices they they make

817
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,279
mobility devices for disadvantaged

818
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,640
children so in sub-saharan africa really

819
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,760
rural

820
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,120
low-income

821
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,480
low-resource

822
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,240
areas

823
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,880
so that's kind of my

824
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,000
it's not a hobby clearly but it is it

825
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,679
feels like a hobby because you know

826
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,440
you're talking a lot to people who try

827
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,880
to do good things and that that's a lot

828
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,600
of fun and then you can bring in some

829
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,720
systems engineering ideas

830
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,640
um my hobby is um as i mentioned before

831
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,799
is trying to bring proper information

832
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,399
management into the systems engineering

833
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,120
world so i think

834
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,640
um systems energy i'm convinced systems

835
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,279
engineering needs really well-structured

836
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,840
information and you know as we have our

837
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,840
experts on system earlier in the room

838
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,559
um and they're working on system l2

839
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,440
who's promising to bring this um into

840
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,520
into the world of our of nbc

841
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,520
you know um i i know that i'm talking to

842
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,080
the right people there so i i really

843
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,520
like to understand what or to build

844
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,279
models that

845
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,760
normal engineers can also understand and

846
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,000
that's like my my hobby

847
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,480
within systems engineering

848
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,039
so you should have joined the system lv2

849
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,080
project that would be great but now we

850
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,679
are

851
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,480
you know finally

852
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,640
almost done almost done um no but what

853
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,919
i've heard about it um it really sounds

854
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,000
like

855
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,679
the ideas i mean to our listeners so

856
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,240
christian tim and i we know each other

857
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,080
from the german chapter and we've come

858
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,720
to the workshop of the german chapter

859
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,600
where we've been discussing this for at

860
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,360
least what seven eight years now

861
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,200
and i think we all had the same

862
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,440
goal at least you know this is where we

863
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,000
need to take mbse

864
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,960
and i'm grateful that you've you've done

865
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,600
it i didn't have the time sorry

866
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,399
no problem

867
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,440
so

868
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,679
yes and part of from that my my favorite

869
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,440
my real favorite hobby is um fisher

870
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,039
technique so i don't know if any

871
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,080
non-germans

872
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,880
don't exist it still exists and my my

873
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,320
kids love it and um we're building

874
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,840
models so i i don't know i have probably

875
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,519
one of the largest collections of visual

876
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,480
technique in

877
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,880
uh in germany and um yes we can build

878
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,880
some really nice models to explain basic

879
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,640
things and that's brilliant and i wanted

880
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,320
to bring it into teaching but it's so

881
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,559
difficult to beat lego um you know

882
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,320
so the the robot called the lego robot i

883
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,120
can't

884
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,240
mind

885
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,240
like

886
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,240
minecraft

887
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,440
yeah

888
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,600
so they they've they're basically you

889
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,399
know they've basically taken over the

890
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,360
university world and although the fisher

891
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,640
dating obviously is a much better system

892
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,720
and the systems engineer should

893
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,440
understand that it is a system whereas

894
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,799
lego is just components who can do

895
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,640
things

896
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,919
but okay

897
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,880
stefan asks if you have the 5000 euros

898
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,080
industry 4.0 factory from visual

899
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,320
technique

900
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,840
no i haven't my dean didn't want to give

901
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,720
it to me

902
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,080
no no no i know in fairness no i didn't

903
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,880
ask for it but i've seen it i've seen

904
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,760
i and i worked with uh

905
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,960
on um digital twins to to connect it to

906
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,760
mbse

907
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,279
and they have all the fish technic kits

908
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,200
for teaching so

909
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,760
i was quite impressed yeah we were

910
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,880
thinking about buying it but then we

911
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,799
stayed also at lego

912
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,000
yeah now 5000 euros is a lot of money

913
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,679
you can buy

914
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,679
five silver sponsorships

915
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,200
yeah that would be

916
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,720
would also be a good thing to do

917
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,640
maybe we should ask fisher dating to do

918
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,120
it and sponsor us in

919
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,039
you know material contributions that's a

920
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,000
good idea

921
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,799
yeah

922
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,799
i'll contact them

923
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,760
all right

924
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,039
so

925
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,840
i would say

926
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:48,320
we are more or less through um yeah we

927
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,039
now know what is going on in september

928
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,320
in

929
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,039
zurich yeah do do all do come just do

930
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,960
come it's it is the best conference

931
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,720
you know what so i i have vacation in

932
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,840
this time and we still do not book

933
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
anything so if we would not book until

934
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,360
then maybe

935
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,720
i will catch the car and

936
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,879
come over

937
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,119
yes plus there's no restrictions in

938
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,520
switzerland or not you know it's it's

939
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,560

uh around lake zurich it's a really nice

961
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,880
destination

962
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,880
all right

963
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
yeah so well what's our next topic

964
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,119
christian

965
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,920
yeah um

966
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,520
according to my mind we will talk about

967
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:18,160
our first uh method and we will talk

968
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,599
about sysmod invented by tim and others

969
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
and

970
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,280
yes

971
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,880
so as we have the expert here

972
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,160
we take sysmod as the first method

973
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,599
and

974
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,240
yeah we

975
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,040
like so often don't have a date yet

976
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,000
ah yes but it will print it but it will

977
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,880
come in within the next weeks

978
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,960
yeah

979
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,480
yeah we need time for the date

980
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,960
that's the issue

981
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,520
is there going to be a system 2.0 when

982
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,640
sml changes

983
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,800
uh

984
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,079
yeah probably it's it should be

985
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,960
interesting to see what's what's the

986
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,560
impact of system lb2 on sysmod so

987
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,800
so this is more or less independent of

988
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,320
the language but not 100 percent

989
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,640
independent i would say there's always

990
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,040
an interdependency and a new language

991
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,079
enables new features and

992
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,240
m1 library for sysmod or something like

993
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,240
that

994
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,960
yeah okay let me know i'll join the

995
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,640

996
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,680
and if you need other methodologies i

997
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,520
can you know find your people

998
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,960
and there's a good framework to evaluate

999
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,960
methodologies but that's also a good

1000
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,640
okay

1001
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,880
