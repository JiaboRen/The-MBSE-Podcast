1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,560
okay so welcome

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,040
to another episode of our mbse podcast

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,240
and

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,639
another episode of our mbse around the

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
world

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,119
series and this time we are in china

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,600
our guest is chung li and since we are

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,039
not good at pronouncing chinese names

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,320
we call him liu so i first

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,960
met leo free for free three years ago i

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
guess

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,679
at the mess conf in shanghai and then

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
again during a business trip

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,320
so usually the mess conf the modeling of

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,600
embedded systems conference

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,360
which i co-organize is held in munich uh

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,680
in germany but we are open to other

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,559
locations so we were in china a few

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,640
years ago

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,600
and this year by the way the mess conf

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,920
will take place virtually due to corona

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:57,039
and you find more details at massconf.de

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,600
so but back to our guest so leo

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
is uh of course active in the field of

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,080
mbse

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,799
uh but he can best tell you about that

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,320
himself so leo please introduce yourself

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,040
okay

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,000
thank you uh thank you team and

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,680
christian

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,280
hello everyone my name is leo

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,560
thanks for the uh team and christmas

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,680
invitation it's great honor to be here

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,280
today my uh i'm leo ceo

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,320
of syscraftlab in 2017

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,960
i created a sysgraph lab

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,680
so we are providing nbc consulting

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,200
service

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:44,399
and mbs product and also

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,680
project uh landing yeah so okay

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,000
yeah cool so leo

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,880
what are the typical car industries in

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,040
china that

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,640
use mbse and they who

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,200
who are your customers typically okay

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
in china the typical industries using

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,759
mbsc

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,440
are aerospace enterprises and also

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,560
auto industry and high-tech

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:17,520
companies yes we can take

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,520
many different kinds of customers

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,720
i guess we have a very so typically we

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,200
in germany think we have a

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,040
large automotive industry but i think in

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,440
china it's much much larger than

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,319
in germany so we have lots and lots of

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
um

58
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,720
automotive vendors yeah okay

59
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,440
um and what is the

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
what is typically the the purpose of

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
mbse

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
in in that projects is it used to for

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,400
the communication between the

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
stakeholders or

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
to specify the product or it's uh

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,160
typically purpose to simulate

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,239
the system so what's the field of

68
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,280
application of mbse

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,040
okay in my opinion i think there are

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,640
four main

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,319
purpose the first is complex system

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,840
architecture management

73
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,720
the designer can use use mbse to

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
represent

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,120
system architecture so they

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,840
they can build a complex system

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,360
this is the first one second is i think

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,000
communication between the stakeholders

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,360
but i think many designers didn't see

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,640
the value

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,760
of the mbse so they need

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,120
a use diagram a picture

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,319
or models to communicate

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,159
but i think different

85
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,840
designers in different

86
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,879
domains they they may

87
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,879
not usually use mbse to

88
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,319
to communicate so i think uh they

89
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,760
there need more improvement

90
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,319
and the third i think um is for rapid

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,879
design

92
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
and validation of conceptual design

93
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,280
process

94
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,319
a treat of multi-conceptual solutions

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,479
mbse is very useful and

96
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,519
the fourth i think design knowledge

97
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,880
management for example knowledge

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,400
representation knowledge accumulation

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,000
knowledge reuse models in mbse

100
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,840
as a carrier of design knowledge

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,800
design experience design date especially

102
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,919
relationships of knowledge is very

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,280
important

104
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,720
so and experienced

105
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,360
designers can abstract refine

106
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
and represent knowledge into different

107
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,160
kinds of models and

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,120
and diagrams it's very easy for

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
knowledge reuse so and knowledge

110
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,759
engineering

111
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,120
and knowledge management is a old topic

112
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:11,680
but i think mbse is very useful

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:14,720
in this old topic but we we need more

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:20,240
practice and application

115
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:23,600
of mbse and the last one i think

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,280
mbse is very useful for evolution

117
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,400
of cognitive process for complex

118
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,919
design from the perspective of

119
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,039
cognitive science design is a

120
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,000
evolutionary process you can also see

121
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,080
design

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,280
as a sparring up upward process

123
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
models and diagrams is very useful and

124
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,120
helpful

125
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,240
for the process of deep thinking so you

126
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,360
can

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,479
like um animation or

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,759
simulation and the animation

129
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:03,280
is a process of different pictures

130
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,240
all we call frames design is a similar

131
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,520
precise

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
so i think mbse is very useful you can

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,280
print

134
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,880
your thinking into different models

135
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,680
or diagrams so you can think deeper and

136
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,039
deeper

137
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,479
so this is a recognitive precise

138
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,880
mbs is very useful yeah

139
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:31,759
and and these five uh

140
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:35,440
perspective is my personal cognition

141
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,319
okay yeah okay and um

142
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,520
what would you estimate how well is mbse

143
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,520
used in china already

144
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,280
although we did a lot of practice but

145
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,639
the channel still has a long way

146
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,400
to go so we need to study

147
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,400
or learn from foreign

148
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,639
wonders or customers how they

149
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,120
practice mbse so i think we need a lot a

150
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,599
lot of

151
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:11,440
um and to study from the deferring

152
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:15,280
and counterparts i think

153
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,240
yeah well i think you're

154
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,919
not alone with that so mbse is in most

155
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,120
countries i would say at the

156
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,560
at the beginning of the adoption um

157
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,199
although it is there for well around 20

158
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
years or so

159
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,880
it's hard to say where was the starting

160
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,560
point of mbse

161
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,759
uh well it would also be interesting to

162
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,759
do a podcast about that but

163
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,160
yeah but in mo in most industries

164
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,560
it's the projects are at the beginning

165
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,639
of course there are some exceptions and

166
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,080
and then it looks very interesting

167
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,120
what you can do with mbsd so that's wow

168
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,000
okay um yeah another important part of

169
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,680
course is

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,520
is the education of mbse so

171
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
what do you think what what is the level

172
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,840
of education

173
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,639
in of mbse in china is it for example

174
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,240
taught

175
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,280
at universities already okay

176
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,319
i think mbs education is still uh

177
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,080
at a relatively elementary

178
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:23,360
level and many universities don't have

179
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,400
mbse courses yeah

180
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,800
and there are not many courses that

181
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,840
teach

182
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,440
mbse in universities at

183
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,479
present and we need to strengthen it

184
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,399
further i think but we we have

185
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,120
many trained trainings for for customers

186
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,800
for

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,399
for the the um

188
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,000
the different domains

189
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,519
we will provide some some training

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,760
that's also yeah that's it

191
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:03,680
okay and maybe

192
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,800
a side question so are other tools

193
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,640
taught in in university like for example

194
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,920
matlab or simulink

195
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,120
or something which is more

196
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,720
yeah yes for example

197
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,000
simulation some simulation tools

198
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,800
entered has entered the universities but

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
the nbc

200
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,720
truth is just the beginning

201
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,839
and at the present got it yes

202
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,440
yeah we we try we try

203
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,480
try to enter for example shanghai john

204
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,720
university

205
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,720
and we cooperate with the

206
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,200
gyoton university teachers so we want to

207
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,080
provide

208
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,279
our tool to the students students can

209
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,320
practice

210
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,279
at the mechanical engineering courses

211
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,640
they can use mbs tools to present a

212
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,240
small system

213
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,519
and b build a system architecture

214
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,079
and so and i think it's just the

215
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,079
beginning

216
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,399
right now yeah okay

217
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,800
and i was wondering uh are there

218
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,000
is there a local chapter of incosia in

219
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,560
china and do you

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,760
have some mbse working groups where

221
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,760
people come together

222
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,279
to exchange information on mbse

223
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,320
yeah yes i i hope that there

224
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,360
and there are so many working groups we

225
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,200
can collect and

226
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,839
communicate or study learn from each

227
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,800
other

228
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,920
but there are not many high quality

229
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,360
working

230
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,279
groups in china i entered in

231
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,200
um i went to united states

232
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,399
i they take and take part in the

233
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,399
some meetings in in there

234
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,920
but in china i think they are not very

235
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:10,560
high quality so we we

236
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,560
we need to improve it

237
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,519
yeah i remember the last time i was

238
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,079
there or

239
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
at the best conference that yeah we had

240
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,480
my friends at

241
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,079
the university in shanghai i don't

242
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
remember the name of the university but

243
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,320
yeah there

244
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,680
yeah uh i also taught talked to some of

245
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,320
the professors there and

246
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,399
uh yeah they also mentioned that mbse is

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,519
not taught at the universities but

248
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
uh if i remembered correctly they said

249
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,160
that

250
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,160
uh the unified modeling language so the

251
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,519
uml and the software engineering domain

252
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,240
is is very common in china can you

253
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,240
do you know that

254
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,040
yeah yes i i i joined the

255
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,560
different meetings or some groups

256
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:04,079
to to discuss how to use mbse

257
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,360
but the the chinese um counterparts

258
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,399
i think need improve their their

259
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,519
professional skills or learn

260
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,560
to different modeling language

261
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,560
so um

262
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,600
i think not not very so many and

263
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,040
like mexico meetings

264
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,320
in china yeah okay yeah so

265
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,560
do you think it makes sense to do

266
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,320
another mbse conference in china

267
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,320
is it yes

268
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:42,800
welcome to china we can call organize

269
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,200
the meetings like mexico yeah i'm very

270
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,680
happy to do that

271
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,720
yeah that was great it was good fun and

272
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,680
very interesting

273
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,680
had a good time there

274
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
yeah so um

275
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,600
it seems you have the typical challenges

276
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,320
of mbse

277
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,160
but uh maybe there are some specifics so

278
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,320
can you tell us a little bit about the

279
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,240
the challenges you observe uh of mbse

280
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,279
uh to adapt that in in the companies in

281
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,079
china so what are their problems

282
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,360
yeah uh i think there are many child

283
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,399
challenge

284
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,600
challenges in china for

285
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,639
uh for customers i think the

286
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,000
further uh maturity

287
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,560
uh of chinese market chinese customers

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
need to

289
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,639
improve their professional skills

290
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,920
in terms of mbse especially in

291
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,120
current digital air error

292
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,240
how to re restructure

293
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,279
the research and

294
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,800
development development process of

295
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,160
complex

296
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,519
system is a big challenge and for

297
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,720
vendors technology accumulation

298
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,279
and export exploration

299
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,079
we know that other countries have been

300
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,120
doing

301
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,000
mbse practice for many years

302
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,880
but for chinese vendors is still

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,079
students

304
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:18,000
i think we need we still need to learn

305
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:21,600
good good experience from foreign

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,240
counterparts how to integrate different

307
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,720
technologies and technical solutions in

308
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,720
global

309
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:35,279
in global it's also a big challenge

310
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,560
so we when we developing this graph

311
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,680
modeler so we found different

312
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,120
um vendors all tech

313
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,480
technology and companies from

314
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,880
other countries so how to integrate

315
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,920
these

316
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,440
different technical solutions is very

317
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,279
is a very big challenge

318
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,320
and for mbse ecosystem and

319
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,680
in china i think china need need

320
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,040
need construct of open ecosystems

321
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,560
for mbs researchers

322
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,959
vendors and customers it need a lot of

323
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,320
work

324
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:19,760
to do yeah

325
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,199
i think this is all challenges for

326
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:27,839
chinese and vendors and customers

327
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:30,639
yeah okay

328
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,800
yeah so you mentioned uh the modeling

329
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,240
tool the sysgraph modeler

330
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,839
so could you give us a short

331
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,920
overview of the tool and maybe for our

332
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,000
listeners of the podcast

333
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,480
this is the point where you should

334
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,519
switch to the youtube video

335
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,720
uh that you can see what leo will show

336
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,880
us but he will also tell us

337
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,120
what we can see there okay no problem

338
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,519
i can share my screen yeah you're

339
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,519
welcome

340
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:13,279
okay

341
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,040
okay okay focus

342
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:21,199
and this is a video uh we

343
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,320
for two years ago we did this project

344
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,440
so you you can look the whole

345
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,120
uh interface and there is

346
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,639
a model 3 here is a

347
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,680
diagram of our table

348
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:42,639
so you can see

349
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:45,680
first we can import requirements

350
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,680
from excel

351
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:54,480
so and the requirement is represented

352
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:58,720
as a table so you can

353
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,720
see different requirements

354
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,600
and here is the requirements tree the

355
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,439
how to

356
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,679
decompose requirements into different

357
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,679
abstraction of level

358
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,959
and you can also see the requirements

359
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,000
diagram designer can

360
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,679
drag requirements elements

361
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,679
into the diagram

362
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,840
you can also drag the requirements from

363
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
model 3.

364
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,799
so you can drag it into the

365
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,000
diagram you can also create

366
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:48,080
different relations relationships

367
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,080
between requirements

368
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,720
so now we create another requirement

369
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
diagram

370
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,559
you drag a requirement

371
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:11,679
and you can also show the relationships

372
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:16,080
of this requirement so you can see

373
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:19,679
the other new requirements is showing

374
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,679
in this network diagram

375
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,840
okay in the model 3 we can build a

376
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,840
different

377
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,400
package

378
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:42,559
now we can conduct a

379
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:45,679
requirements relationship

380
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,840
so you can choose the first requirement

381
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:57,840
you can also check

382
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:57,840
which tab you want to send

383
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,960
so the uh um our product can show the

384
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,720
relationships between

385
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,160
different level requirements

386
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,600
so you can see how to

387
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,919
decompose plaques

388
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,919
over overall requirements

389
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,000
and you can also show the relationships

390
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:39,840
between

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:39,840
requirements and structure

392
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:52,000
and here we just show the system

393
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:55,200
system architecture you can see how to

394
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,480
decompose a a system block

395
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:03,039
there there are so many subsystems or

396
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:06,880
subsystem systems of systems

397
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,360
how to decompose a um

398
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
systems

399
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,679
and we can also show the requirements

400
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,840
the relationship

401
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,840
between requirements and structure

402
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,960
what is the pxs system is it a

403
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,840
ah it's a name of a

404
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:49,840
structure in in

405
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:49,840
nuclear domain okay

406
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,080
and here we can see the requirements and

407
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,840
you can link the requirements and

408
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,840
into the structure

409
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
so you can see what's the relationships

410
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,440
between requirements and

411
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,440
structure

412
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,650
and now we can create a

413
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,650
[Music]

414
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,870
table here requirement yeah

415
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,080
so you can see uh a block

416
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,440
[Music]

417
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,400
how many ports it has ah okay

418
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,520
so it's an interface control document

419
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,960
yes

420
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,960
yes we

421
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:07,039
yes we can see uh uh ibd

422
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:10,720
diagram so you can see uh in a

423
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:13,840
blog um how how this block

424
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,120
is composed and be composed of

425
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,120
different blocks

426
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,650
[Music]

427
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:31,600
so here this table can show the

428
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:34,720
interface between different blocks

429
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,720
housing can connect

430
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,520
and here is a par diagram

431
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:47,280
so we integrate matlab

432
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,480
there is a matlab file so you can drag

433
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,760
drag this file into our product

434
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,280
so it analyzes

435
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,039
and and as a

436
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,039
computational model

437
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:09,840
can you execute input and output

438
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,840
and can you execute it yes

439
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:23,840
so when you input different values

440
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,840
and it can compute

441
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,679
but the computation is done by matlab

442
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,720
right that's

443
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:37,840
the background as a

444
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,840
computational engine

445
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:46,880
and here we can see the

446
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,880
block how to satisfy a requirement

447
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,000
it's amazing even if everything is in

448
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,960
chinese

449
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,159
i can understand what what what is shown

450
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,799
because of

451
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,679
yeah because it's the smell compliant in

452
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:09,039
its shapes

453
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:12,559
and i know assist male and now is

454
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:15,600
uh sits about 2.0

455
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,279
so maybe this male has a very big

456
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:23,120
difference yes 2.0

457
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:26,480
yeah yes yes that will be a big change

458
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:30,000
yeah do you plan to implement

459
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:34,320
system l version 2 um yes we

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,840
we are we are studying uh cis male 2.0

461
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:42,080
so we are evaluating eight

462
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:45,200
uh okay whether we can support to 2.0

463
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,960
very good yeah and we can also

464
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,440
export the model on date into

465
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,440
excel

466
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:02,320
so that's the icd table in excel

467
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:07,200
yeah yes we can export the all

468
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,200
uh all of the model in our product

469
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,200
yeah if customer customer customer

470
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,840
need some date we can we can

471
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,840
export it

472
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,960
and do you have a rest interface

473
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,159
also for the tool so that you can access

474
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,159
via web services

475
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:40,240
now currently we didn't provide

476
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:44,799
web service api or services to

477
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:48,480
to to other and customers

478
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,120
okay that's all this is a very simple

479
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,640
brief

480
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,120
uh introduction of our our product

481
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
yeah very good so last thing we saw is a

482
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,360
document generation then right

483
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:05,200
yes yeah very good

484
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:09,600
fantastic yes okay we

485
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:13,600
we spent we spent about two or three uh

486
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:16,799
three years to to develop this product

487
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,000
so it's very um not

488
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:23,440
very um maturity

489
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,960
material yes we need a lot of

490
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,200
work to do and based on customers

491
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,799
requirement

492
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,159
and now we are trying to to

493
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,679
to discuss with our customers

494
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:45,360
we provide some customer customer

495
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:47,039
customized development for our customers

496
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,640
and how many people are developing on

497
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,640
this um

498
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:59,600
about 15 people

499
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,600
whoa yeah we are as a small team

500
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:08,960
yeah spent nearly

501
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:12,000
two two years two and a half years

502
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,080
all right yeah very good and is

503
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,400
the tool also available in in english

504
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,640
and so in other languages or is it only

505
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,760
available in chinese

506
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,039
um currently we're just providing a

507
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,480
chinese version uh if

508
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,840
uh if some foreign customers

509

and you said that you create customized

514
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,600
versions

515
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,600
of your tools so

516
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,640
is it only a configuration or is it a

517
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,679
real customized so

518
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,240
with special programmed stuff for for

519
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,679
the customer

for one of your customers is it only a

523
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,320
special configuration or is it

524
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,960
uh do you have to write source code for

525
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,679
them

526
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,200
and to create a specific version for the

527
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,120
customer

528
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:21,120
okay and now we we don't provide a

529
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:24,240
source code to to our customers

530
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,039
based on our product but if our

531
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,039
requirement

532
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,840
is new we can provide not based on

533
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,640
our product we can provide source code

534
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,640
to customers

535
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:42,080
okay yeah and

536
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,240
uh is this graph the the only system l

537
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,640
modeling tool in china so

538
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:52,559
a chinese modeling tool yes

539
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:56,320
currently we are chinese too okay

540
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,919
yeah very good so

541
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,360
if we can have more discussions

542
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,720
like today we are very happy to

543
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:10,880
provide our service to foreign customers

544
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,640
so we can discuss together

545
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,200
how we can have more meetings like today

546
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,320
so we are very happy to provide our

547
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,520
services

548
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,200
to to foreign customers

549
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,039
yeah okay yeah maybe someone is

550
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,080
interested who's watching us

551
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,159
okay um

552
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,120
i have one more question about the tool

553
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,399
uh how's

554
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,960
the the model stored is it the file

555
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,080
on on the on your hard disk or is it in

556
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,080
a database

557
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,600
or is it on a server okay and now

558
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,640
our modeling tool is a

559
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,760
single singly

560
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,120
and it's just a software we start our

561
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,399
model and date

562
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:02,000
in the disk

563
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:05,440
yes and we

564
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,120
we we did a lot of um research

565
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,480
we tried to store our data into

566
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:16,480
no secure database for example

567
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,440
neo4j we can store our model into

568
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,440
a knowledge graph

569
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:27,440
we did a lot of research and demo

570
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,440
for that but now we didn't um

571
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:35,039
integrate it into our product

572
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,840
okay but but basically it's

573
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,799
possible then for example to store it in

574
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,919
neo4j

575
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:45,200
but for example yeah yeah

576
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:49,200
yes we did a lot of demos for that

577
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:53,120
we also integrate speech recognition

578
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,399
we the customer can ask a question

579
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,919
and then we translate it into different

580
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:04,080
text and we

581
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:07,039
analysis it we can search in

582
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,000
neo4j and give the answer answer to

583
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,200
customers

584
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,399
we did a lot of demos for that very

585
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,440
interesting yeah

586
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,559
yeah i read you uh also did some work in

587
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,159
the

588
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,919
not specific for this group but you you

589
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,760
also worked in the field of artificial

590
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,880
intelligence right

591
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,960
yeah yes that's what i feel well yeah

592
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,320
before this graph i um play a role of

593
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,600
ai researchers fellow

594
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,320
in a company for many years so we tried

595
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,919
two different

596
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:45,760
ai technologies for example and

597
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,640
machine learning and and and

598
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,159
knowledge graph so we did a lot of

599
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,880
research

600
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:58,080
but um if you want to landing the

601
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,120
ai in real project it's very

602
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:05,200
um a little difficult for

603
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,519
fun now right now yeah yeah

604
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,240
yeah i think it's in the beginning but

605
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,440
uh yes

606
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,760
it's it's a starting topic so i i uh

607
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,360
read more and more about it about ai in

608
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,679
combination with mbse

609
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,399
and so there's even a conference or a

610
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,279
workshop

611
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,840
here in europe uh it was held in in

612
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,760
spain

613
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,919
two years ago and last year it was due

614
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,200
to covert only virtually

615
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,640
uh so it's also supported by cosy

616
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,240
that's a that's a really interesting

617
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,919
combination

618
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,919
yeah yeah absolutely

619
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:43,840
yes so yeah if you want to and do ai

620
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,840
research you need um

621
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,120
more more date or models but for fse the

622
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,159
customers

623
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,519
it's just beginning to accumulate

624
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,559
models so you can represent your

625
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:02,240
knowledge experience into

626
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,679
model so you you need to accumulate

627
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,320
more models and dates but for

628
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,600
more chinese customers i think it's just

629
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,799
a beginning

630
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,320
for mbse there are not many

631
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:20,559
models not many data

632
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:24,960
in models so we have a long road to

633
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:28,000
to to to go i think

634
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,120
and after that you can do

635
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:38,240
many uh artificial intelligence

636
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:39,679
proprieties no we don't have very models

637
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,960
yeah i think that's an issue to have the

638
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:46,000
data for for ai technologies

639
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,480
yeah well but it will come

640
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,480
definitely

641
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,080
uh okay uh do you have any questions

642
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,559
online question are there any

643
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,880
live channels no live questions i think

644
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,279
we are a little bit early today

645
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,080
for the european listeners it's very

646
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,490
