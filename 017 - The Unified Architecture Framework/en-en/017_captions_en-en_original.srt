00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,480
hello and welcome to our new episode of

4
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,640
the mbse podcast

5
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,439
today we are talking about

6
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,240
and framework for the first time

7
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,119
and we are talking about the unified

8
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,400
architecture framework also known as omg

9
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,560
uaf

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,119
and therefore we have a guest

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,240
and i would say a friend

12
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,240

16
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,040
yourself and i guess you can pronounce

17
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,360
your name better than me

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
thank you christian uh hello everyone

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,119
hello tim uh

as

21
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,040
christian introduced my name is aurelius

markavichis

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,840
and i'm

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,000
working for the system as the expert on

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,720
mbsc and enterprise architectures and

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,960
also as a leader of experts a team of

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,040
experts in the mbsc and enterprise

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,479
architecture focusing on

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,200
sesame

30
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,600
and also uaf and nato architecture

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
framework

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,560
consulting and

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,800
teaching and expertise to our clients

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
and also probably more important to

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,599
mention in this context is

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,959
my work with the omg and

37
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,560
co-chairing

38
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,640
the uaf standard in omg for for more

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,520
than 10 years already

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,520
wow

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
wow that's a long time so

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,879
yeah so welcome already thanks for

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,000
joining us in our podcast um

44
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,440
yeah the uaf that's quite interesting um

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
let's start with the

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080
um

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,319
with the framework of architecture

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
framework what what is it what what is

49
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:50,480
an architecture framework now is it is

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,480
it a is a method or a methodology and

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
how do you define architecture

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,560
frameworks

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,400
uh that's that's exactly a good question

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,239
is um

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,159
now it's really um called the

56
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,840
architecture description framework to be

57
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,560
very precise

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
according to iso 42010 this is kind of a

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,879
new thing for us as well

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,319
and and that really stands for some you

61
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,560
know uh best best practices um for for

62
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,400
some um structure

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,480
um which

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,760
allows you which gives you some some

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,480
basic background of how you um

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
create the the model of the system of

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
interest or

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,959
the enterprise really depend on what we

69
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
are talking about

70
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,400
but it not always include the

71
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,000
methodology behind it or or a method so

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,799
that can be a part

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,640
like looking into toga for example but

74
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,159
in some other frameworks it's it's it's

75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,760
not the case

76
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,519
and

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,080
really this is this is the point where

78
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,840
uh i think i i wanted really to um

79
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,799
emphasize a little bit about the book

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
that

81
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,599
uh i wrote recently we think of the uk

82
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,239
that uh don't panic

83
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,760
um sirius which is the absolute

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,959
beginner's guide to the architecture

85
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,959
frameworks

86
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,360
so if you if you want to learn more

87
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,519
you're welcome to to look for it online

88
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,760
there is a book available and it has all

89
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,840
the explanation of all those

90
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
you know terminology things

91
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,639
all right okay so um

92
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,960
uaf like it's called today has a long

93
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,400
history and even

94
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,199
omg it was called updm before and

95
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,080
even there before there was some history

96
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,600
can you give us a brief introduction to

97
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,840
this

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
absolutely actually at the beginning it

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,759
was called updm the unified profile for

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,560
dodaf and modaf which initially uh has

101
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,080
been released in 2009

102
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,919
uh prior this

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,440
it's been it's been a long work to come

104
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,199
to this point but

105
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,720
basically the need was to unify the

106
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
department of defense architecture

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,800
frameworks and ministry of defense

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
architecture frameworks this uk and and

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
us

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,840
common military projects

111
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,199
later later on it evolved

112
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,400
but only in in 2017 we actually renamed

113
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,039
it to uaf

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,680
uh and and of course

115
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
why uif uh you can ask it's because we

116
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
we wanted to

117
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,199
commercialize it or sometimes we call it

118
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,199
demilitarize it

119
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
whatever you can you can look from both

120
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,000
sides

121
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,160
and

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,120
this was the idea of changing the name

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,720
because updm was very very uh related to

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
the military

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
background and

126
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
also in between the lines

127
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,720
the updm

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,440
also became an iso standard into 2017

129
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,720
and now we are working with uh iso to to

130
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,039
publish uaf uh version 1.1 and this this

131
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,360
should happen pretty soon because

132
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,360
the votes were we passed already and

133
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,600
it's just a question of uh

134
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,759
editing and publishing procedure and

135
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,240
then of course you know looking looking

136
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,880
further is

137
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,560
continue working on on the uaf and

138
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,680
specific focus

139
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,400
um

140
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,560
to the needs not only of defense clients

141
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,880
but also on the commercial clients that

142
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,680
we have

143
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,720
okay

144
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
so

145
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,840
well it's

146
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,880
based on modaf and dota or that's

147
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,880
part of their history

148
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,960
also mentioned togaf

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,880
and

150
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
there's another architectural framework

151
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,520
a military architecture framework called

152
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,000
enough

153
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,800
the nato architecture framework so is

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,840
there a relationship from uaf to togaf

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,840
and uaf to naf

156
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,240
uh

157
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,120
yeah actually at least with naf there is

158
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,639
a strong relationship and

159
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
we started with the release of the nato

160
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,560
architecture framework 4 which happened

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,039
a year ago

162
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,080
just probably a year before we started

163
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,400
close collaboration with the nato

164
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,960
architecture capability team

165
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,360
where where we had um

166
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,680
some some common meetings uh either them

167
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,800
coming to the omg meetings or we uh

168
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,919
going to the uh nato uh architecture

169
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,000
capability team meetings and uh

170
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,800
officially uaf is

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,680
one of the two meta models for nato

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,960
architecture uh version uh nato

173
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,840
architecture framework version four

174
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,599
the other being archimate uh and um

175
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,639
uh there is no

176
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,479
metamodel developed by the nato uh today

177
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
because it's it's really

178
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,759
um

179
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,160
a lot of resources demanding uh

180
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,800
endeavor and then they decided to go

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,199
with some standard

182
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,479
bodies like omg for example or the open

183
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,520
group

184
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,840
the relationship with togaf is um

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,240
is obviously not so clear it's it's not

186
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,599
clearly described in in any of the

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,360
specifications nor in uaf and either in

188
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,440
togaf

189
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,520
and and as they're really coming from

190
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,080
the very different worlds it's not not

191
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,160
so easy to connect and specifically

192
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,319
we're facing this within nato where we

193
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
have models produced in archimate which

194
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,280
is also the open group so it's similar

195
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,199
to

196
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,400
um to togaf um in in its um let's say

197
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,319
from the terminology point of view and

198
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,879
this is where we sometimes have a need

199
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
to be able to interchange these models

200
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,760
but

201
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,519
it's it's work in progress

202
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,880
i would say and at the moment there is

203
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,839
no clear

204
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,760
description of it where in some examples

205
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,760
people are taking uaf um and they are

206
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,600
using togaf architecture development

207
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,440
method

208
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,320
which provides steps of how to create

209
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,720
the architecture and and that this

210
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,360
happens because we didn't have one

211
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,279
uh the method in in uaf before and we

212
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,640
still don't but in the next version in

213
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,040
the in the 1.2 version coming out

214
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,040
next year we're going to introduce the

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,320
ua so-called uaf guide as the appendix

216
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
to the spec

217
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,440
which is the um kind of a method

218
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,560
approach how you go from you know a to z

219
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,560
in in creating the the uaf models

220
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
okay okay

221
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,519
and

222
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,440
uh chris everyone my question regarding

223
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,519
the military stuff uh

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,120
you said you uh removed the military

225
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,200
stuff from from

226
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,880
upgm which creates then uaf um so what

227
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,440
exactly did you do how how what should

228
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,000
what was removed from from the the

229
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,839
standard uh to exclude the military

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,480
stuff and at the same time it's uh

231
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,160
conformed to the the naf and and the

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,040
other stuff so

233
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,320
it's it's it's mainly about terminology

234
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,640
um the name itself like updm uh it talks

235
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,600
about dodaf and modaf so we just change

236
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,160
it to to the uaf um and then

237
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,120
some terminology some concepts that we

238
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,839
had like for example in in in in dodaf

239
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,920
world there is a concept of a node

240
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,600
is the same in modaf which represents

241
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,640
you know some structural block

242
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,720
uh in the operational scenario

243
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,720
uh we we

244
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,839
replaced it by the operational performer

245
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,040
which sound more um

246
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,839
let's say

247
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,120
universal right more genericized than

248
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
than the node

249
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,600
um some some other terminology

250
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,519
that that we also had like uh you know

251
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,640
doctrine doctrine

252
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,399
um and and and

253
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,519
it's basically basically basically

254
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,120
around that

255
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,320
but then we

256
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
solved

257
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,880
the traceability question by

258
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
creating

259
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
a additional

260
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,959
document

261
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,839
with the specification called the

262
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,959
traceability document and it has all the

263
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,880
mapping to the different frameworks

264
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,880
just to make the terminology clear

265
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,279
okay great

266
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,200
yeah and uh one thing that would be

267
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,880
interesting for me is

268
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,040
how did uaf or its predecessors become

269
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,000
an omg standard why why did military

270
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,000
come to omg

271
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,000
uh

272
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,440
yeah it's uh it's it's a it's a long

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,880
long story but um

274
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,279
it was really at that time there was a

275
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,240
big involvement of the uh

276
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,120
dod within omg

277
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
and and uh the big representation from

278
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,480
uh

279
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,800
big big names and um even even a dod cio

280
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,240
has been a common participant in in the

281
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
omg meetings

282
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,480
clearly expressing the need of

283
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,000
interchange uh and and this this was

284
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,920
where the idea of of updm started

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,959
strongly driven by the ibm at the

286
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,399
beginning uh later we had some some some

287
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,120
issues and conflicts between the

288
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,639
different group of groups of interest

289
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,600
um ibm even uh vetoed the first release

290
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
of the

291
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,519
of the uaf and uh that

292
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,720
a little bit uh you know um

293
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,399
postponed the release of the

294
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,120
specification of the uptm specification

295
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,040
but uh well nevertheless

296
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,800
later on the obstacle obstacles were

297
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,720
were gone we found an agreement and

298
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,360
there was the the

299
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
the updm released and

300
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,519
after that

301
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,839
as i said uh you know we we really got a

302
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,079
lot of requests from other industries as

303
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,760
well not not purely from the defense and

304
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,880
other frameworks like even in defense

305
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,560
like naf

306
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,360
which was not

307
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,120
a part of the updm at the beginning

308
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
with nato architecture framework and

309
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
later on we just had more frameworks to

310
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,279
incorporate

311
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,920
more frameworks to support more more uh

312
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,839
communities to to support

313
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,800
and and this is where the idea of

314
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,639
uaf um

315
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,880
came to our mind we we had to fight

316
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,320
strongly to get this name because you

317
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,639
know other

318
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,240
groups of interest especially coming for

319
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,079
from business architecture said no no

320
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,600
this is this cannot be unified you know

321
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,000
because we have different frameworks

322
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,240
from bpmn and other stuff

323
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,240
um but but finally we managed to to

324
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
register it so it's registered trademark

325
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,160
of omg and it's um

326
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,240
it's it's it's now said that it's for

327
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,279
multiple purposes right is for for

328
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,720
defense

329
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,959
for for uh industry and for for and also

330
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,160
for for uh federate uh federal

331
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,120
government

332
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,279
so it can be used for for different um

333
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,360
purposes and use cases can i also use it

334
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,920
for for enterprise modeling so for

335
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,079
enterprise architectures

336
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,639
or only for systems or products

337
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,639
we can with the uh of course we try to

338
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,480
talk about this this idea and we really

339
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
think that that the future of the

340
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,199
enterprise uh

341
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,240
architecture is really in uh what we

342
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,240
call um enterprise as a system

343
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,720
uh so so this is where

344
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,920
you know enterprise is just a complex

345
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,079
system or or even the system of systems

346
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,880
at some point depends how you look at it

347
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,920
and it can be analyzed

348
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,959
similar way as any kind of other system

349
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,880
it can be um you know

350
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,959
some of the things can be simulated

351
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,360
within the enterprise

352
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,279
and and it really lacks today more

353
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,120
precise description to be able to do

354
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,120
that if we look into today's

355
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,720
architecture frameworks it's

356
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,000
enterprise architecture

357
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,240
and how it's done in different

358
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,519
organizations it's really powerpoint and

359
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,440
and and and visio and

360
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,519
well sometimes togaf but

361
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
then what what togaf is if if you look

362
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,320
into togaf that there is meta model but

363
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,800
there is no formal way of um really you

364
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,120
know uh implementing that meta model so

365
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,360
so you can use uml or user

366
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
you can use you know bpmn or some other

367
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,880
language

368
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,680
but but that's that's not really

369
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,519
getting uh getting to to to the right

370
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,760
point where you have everything unified

371
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,079
and you can you know validate your model

372
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,560
simulate your models and this is where

373
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,240
we're we're going with uaf it's yes it's

374
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,480
coming from the different world it's

375
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,199
coming from the engineering world it's

376
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,600
much more precise uh and it means that

377
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,519
um even if the complexity is higher at

378
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,639
the end you can achieve

379
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,199
a better consistency um in in your

380
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,839
architectural uh description

381
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,240
and you create for the enterprise

382
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
okay

383
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,279
so

384
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,440
i'm

385
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,759
still not sure if our listeners

386
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,759
know what uif is and what you can do

387
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,079
with uif and

388
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:02,079
to my knowledge you are modeling

389
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:03,920
structures and behavior and missions and

390
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,079
something that

391
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,480
that has to be achieved and to my

392
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,959
knowledge you you use many other

393
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,759
standards can you give us a little bit

394
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,199
of insight to that

395
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
we do

396
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,519
so

397
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,440
first of all probably i would say that

398
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,519
uaf

399
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,680
has a couple of parts within the

400
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,519
specification one of the parts is the

401
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,279
conceptual meta model

402
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,000
which is um

403
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,000
based on on uml but it's not really you

404
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,399
know the implementation or the languages

405
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,279
it's just the conceptual metamodel

406
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,160
providing a number of

407
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,160
concepts and their relationships

408
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,160
and and how they're used and where they

409
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,040
supposed to be used but going further

410
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,480
there is

411
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,560
the standard implementation of the uaf

412
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
today it's called uaf profile and

413
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,199
tomorrow is going to be called

414
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,800
uaf modeling language

415
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,440
so so we're changing that to make it

416
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,360
more obvious and more aligned with sml

417
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,480
for example which is systems modeling

418
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
language

419
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,760
and

420
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,199
specifically uif modeling language is

421
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,439
based uh

422
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,360
as a profile of uml of course it's first

423
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,360
based on on the uml

424
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,600
but it's also based on sml with the

425
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,720
tight relationship to sml

426
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,760
and

427
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,600
we use systeml diagrams to represent

428
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,679
uaf data

429
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,079
um so at the end

430
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,919
you know it's it's strongly dependent on

431
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,760
on this sml

432
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,320
today because we don't define our

433
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,679
notation we use the system of standard

434
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,280
decimal notation we just define the

435
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,640
the the number of elements that you

436
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,160
would use within um sesame diagrams

437
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,480
uh then we have some dependency on bpmn

438
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,720
it's not exactly dependency it's more

439
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,880
it's more how you use both together

440
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,000
you can use bpmn

441
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,559
to be more precise the the profile

442
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,200
uml profile for bpmn which is a

443
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,720
different standard than bpmn

444
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,760
to express

445
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,720
process models so like operational

446
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,440
activity models or function models

447
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,679
uh security processes models and and so

448
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,280
on and there are some other standards

449
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,600
where we have some hooks too it's not

450
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,160
that we incorporate them uh or we use

451
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,160
them so we we have some relation to niem

452
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,280
which is national uh information

453
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,960
exchange

454
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,640
model or ieppv which i can hardly uh

455
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,039
spell

456
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,440
then the base profile

457
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
recently has been developed

458
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,559
so

459
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
base profile for uaf is really extending

460
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,679
uaf towards

461
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,960
supporting face standard that's here

462
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,799
airspace here for standard and then

463
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,760
possibly we will have some relationship

464
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,440
to a risk analysis and an assurance

465
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,640
modeling language

466
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,320
which is

467
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,160
upcoming standard

468
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,679
in the omg so so there are tight

469
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,679
relationships and of course for data

470
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,640
exchange it's it's xmi

471
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
uh

472
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,440
standard

473
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,200
okay so

474
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,919
and yeah you mentioned you have uh but

475
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,679
you have this this meter model of uaf

476
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,000
and system l

477
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,840
and i assume also b and n all this other

478
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,840
stuff is only

479
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,000
one possible implementation

480
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,840
of this beta model so theoretically i

481
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,039
could also use um

482
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,559
capella

483
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,880
for uaf

484
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,600
and and any other

485
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,440
systems modeling language uh like yeah

486
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,720
capella or uh or opm uh and maybe the

487
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,600
other around

488
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,840
uh this is that true so system is just

489
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,679
an implementation of the meter model

490
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,200
that's that's that's correct it's uh

491
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
it's just we call standard

492
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,080
implementation because we have a

493
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,880
published omg standard for that

494
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,880
okay

495
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,840
and of course it's much easier to use

496
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,919
the

497
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,520
system then creating your own modeling

498
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,840
language and then the tool vendors must

499
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,640
create their own tools and so on

500
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,520
um yeah speaking of tools um is url

501
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,840
bound to a specific tool but do i need a

502
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,280
uaf

503
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,360
tool uh

504
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,440
it's actually it's it's it's not too

505
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,520
specific so it's like a standard it's

506
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,760
too agnostic

507
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,039
i would say it's really um you know two

508
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,600
vendors are highly involved in

509
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,200
development of the standard um

510
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
so so for this

511
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,120
historically we we had and still have

512
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,600
many tool vendors attending

513
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,520
um and and um a lot of them are our

514
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,200
system well as we just discussed so so

515
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,440
there are some um

516
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,919
tool vendors coming from

517
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,880
different world

518
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,159
like like mega for example and mega opex

519
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,640
tool or or the system architect

520
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,440
which is also not sesame based

521
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,960
so there are there are examples and

522
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,840
as you said there might be different

523
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,320
different implementations of it

524
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,159
so so it's really not um

525
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,280
not dependent on the specific tool but

526
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,559
on the other side you know um

527
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,280
probably

528
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,400
tools that implement uaf specifically

529
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,520
and and they highlight that they

530
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,240
implement uif they provide um

531
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,120
slightly different experience towards

532
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,280
you know creating uaf models than

533
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,840
if you would do it without the specific

534
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,840
tool

535
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,600
okay but that means that a tool that

536
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,919
supports only so small would not be

537
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,919
enough

538
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,320
uh well definitely uh

539
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,880
probably not

540
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,640
theoretically it could could could be um

541
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,400
you could could use it for one or the

542
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,720
other view when you say okay i'm just

543
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,679
using uaf um grid which just have a list

544
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,520
of views that you need to create

545
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,559
and and then you create them in the

546
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,720
different

547
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,640
sesame diagrams but at the end to get

548
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,520
you know the full experience the the

549
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
metamodel compliance with the omg

550
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,799
standard

551
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,960
you you need you need to have um uaf uh

552
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,799
specific tool but at the end just adding

553
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,640
adding to this point you know what we

554
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,480
see sometimes in industry and not

555
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,480
necessarily in defense

556
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,400
that uh people take a small and and they

557
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,120
highly customize it

558
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,200
they highly customize it they extend it

559
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,640
and at the end they they come very close

560
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,320
to to what really uaf is today

561
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,720
what do we have what do we do in systems

562
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,400
engineering we do operational analysis

563
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,039
uh we do functional

564
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,799
architecture we do logical architecture

565
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,679
and you know this actually corresponds

566
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,039
to the to the views that that we have in

567
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,640
in the uaf

568
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,919
sometimes you know you need features you

569
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,799
need capabilities it depends on on which

570
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,159
which

571
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,559
industry you are

572
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,440
and and and those kind of concepts you

573
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,720
know are are also um something you you

574
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,799
extend

575
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
so sometimes you know you you you get

576
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,440
close to it just

577
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,679
over customizing system now

578
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,679
not not even knowing that you do that

579
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,400
so um so if but if i use a standard

580
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:14,240
system a tool um to to yeah apply uaf

581
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,520
um and also an um bpmn modeling tool to

582
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,679
apply uaf so the bpmn part of uaf

583
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,799
now i have two tools with two models uh

584
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,840
and i need some kind of exchange of data

585
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,799
and have this inter operability issue so

586
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,240
is there a standard exchange format for

587
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,159
uaf

588
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,720
models what data

589
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,640
the the standard exchange is is for a

590
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,480
sml implementation

591
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,080
only so if you are

592
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,640
you if you if you have uh you know small

593
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,559
if you if you implement uaf modeling

594
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,520
using qf modeling language which is

595
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,760
based on sml then you can use xmi to

596
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,000
interchange or diagram interchange

597
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,000
format which which is there by omg so

598
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,320
i'm not sure that there are tools really

599
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,240
implementing it but theoretically

600
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,679
theoretically should be

601
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,440
should be possible

602
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,440
using those standards but if you use

603
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
some proprietary implementation then

604
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,000
then you probably have to have some

605
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,000
exporter into the correct xmi format

606
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,760
okay

607
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,159
so

608
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,919
as uif is a huge framework

609
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,240
we cannot go into every detail today

610
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:30,240
but could you give us some example

611
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:34,000
aspects of views that are created or

612
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,000
covered by uaf

613
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,279
uh

614
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,640
yeah absolutely you know saying huge

615
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,559
it's uh it's probably the right word but

616
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,880
uh we used to say that when you when you

617
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,039
look into uaf for for some people you

618
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,320
know this this grid that we have reminds

619
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,039
us reminds the uh periodic table of

620
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,120
elements that we learn at school

621
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,000
um and and you know but you usually

622
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,600
don't use the all the elements there to

623
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,600
to to create um new composite material

624
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,960
you just take you know somewhat what you

625
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,240
need like hydrogen oxygen for the water

626
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,960
so so it's similar here we we just say

627
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,039
okay so it's like foundation giving you

628
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,000
everything and you just need to pick the

629
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:21,200
right things and primarily you know the

630
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,840
the core uh core viewpoints that we uh

631
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,520
have is the strategic operational and

632
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,480
resources

633
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,159
um where you know uh really represent

634
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,880
three different layers of abstraction

635
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,640
starting from one strategy and uh

636
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,039
answering question why

637
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,679
this is about you know capabilities and

638
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,520
their realization in time the strategy

639
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,320
from the enterprise

640
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,320
level how you go from one

641
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,080
state of the enterprise to the other

642
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,559
from one state of the system or system

643
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,760
of systems to the other

644
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,400
how that changed in terms of

645
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,200
capabilities in terms of features

646
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,279
really dependent um on on the goals you

647
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,400
have uh then then we go to the

648
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,840
operational scenarios to to to describe

649
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,679
um

650
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,320
also uh

651
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,440
what we need to do to achieve the goals

652
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,200
and

653
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,000
achieve the capabilities so the

654
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,559
operational scenarios are really related

655
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,960
to the environment to the user uh who's

656
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,960
using the the system of interest what

657
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,520
the the main players how they how they

658
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,080
communicate what are

659
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,559
the the process uh behind it

660
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,480
and and finally you know on

661
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,159
how we implement those operational

662
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,559
scenarios is where we talk about

663
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,320
resources and um

664
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,520
when we talk about resources we talk

665
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,000
about

666
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,880
people we talk about

667
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,520
software we talk about systems hardware

668
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,200
etc natural resources

669
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,200
so there are many different types of

670
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,159
resources that needs to collaborate

671
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,039
together

672
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,799
to to achieve the goals and you know we

673
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,919
sometimes take take an example if you

674
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,720
have um

675
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,799
if you model the missile and um you know

676
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,520
the missile system of interest for for

677
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,320
for for for some and it's been

678
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,880
um for the company that designs it right

679
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,559
uh but if we if we look from the uh

680
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,679
ministry of defense perspective for

681
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,600
example uh then you know they're buying

682
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,159
not only the missile but they need to

683
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,159
understand how they are going to use it

684
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,559
so they need the launch platform they

685
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,960
need some transportation how to move it

686
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,919
from one place to the other or some uh

687
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,159
if it's stationary some some place to

688
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,919
place it they need personnel to be able

689
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,399
to to be capable

690
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,279
to use it so they have to do training uh

691
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,159
they have to have some competencies and

692
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,919
all

693
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,640
these kind of things they can be they

694
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,039
can be captured and modeled and and that

695
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,919
usually goes just beyond the simple uh

696
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,240
you know system of interest

697
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,039
and of course there are some other other

698
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,720
um

699
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,279
viewpoints in addition like security

700
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,240
which quite important these days

701
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,320
you know to cyber security

702
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,360
in any industry it's it's not it's not

703
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,320
specifically a defense on um

704
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,240
some standards and and and services but

705
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,880
it's really about these three and and

706
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,679
how they how they um relate together and

707
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,720
traceability between them

708
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,880
so that's so to say uh the the

709
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,120
the default approach how to start with

710
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,760
your effort the the minimal

711
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,760
uif so to say i think at first glance it

712
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,080
seems for many people daunting and too

713
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,320
extensive but people also say the same

714
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,520
about assistant and human that's too

715
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,159
complex too much and

716
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,000
but they do not understand that it's

717
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,840
only a language

718
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,520
an offer and you don't have to pick

719
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,480
everything

720
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,520
and

721
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,880
uaf um is much much more like if you

722
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,480
open up publications about uaf it's

723
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,279
all these viewpoints and

724
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,559
so

725
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,640
your recommendation is then um if i do

726
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,279
not have a specific plan uh to start

727
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,679
with uif i start with these three major

728
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,320
viewpoints then right straight that's

729
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,919
exactly the case and then yeah okay yeah

730
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,159
that's exactly the case plus you know we

731
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,320
have those uh also columns that

732
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,559
represent different types of diagrams

733
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,240
different xsml that's that's called

734
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,039
pillars sometimes you know like

735
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,960
requirements structure behavior

736
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,720
so we have we have more of those and

737
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,200
then you you can also decide you know

738
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,520
which ones you you need to do so like uh

739
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,279
you know requirements structure behavior

740
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,880
they're usually

741
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,840
what you commonly do

742
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,200
when we go more towards constraints or

743
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,440
you know the

744
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,360
time aspect that's not

745
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,799
something you always do it just really

746
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,559
depends on

747
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,279
you know parametrics the same in small

748
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,039
you know

749
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,240
don't do parametrics all the time it's

750
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,679
just for some specific uh tasks

751
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,679
usually

752
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,840
it reminds me a bit of product line

753
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,320
engineering so i have a set of features

754
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,640
that i can use

755
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,720
and then i also have these uh

756
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,480
feature constraints so if i select this

757
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,720
feature i also have to select that

758
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,960
feature or if i select this feature i

759
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,600
cannot use this feature uh you have

760
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,320
similar constraints in uaf or a

761
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,399
guideline how how i can select the the

762
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,080
right features so at the end that i for

763
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,640
example still have a traceability in the

764
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,760
model which doesn't work if i remove

765
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,399
one important part of the chain

766
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,760
uh so so there is uh probably the uaf

767
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,520
guide that i mentioned that's coming

768
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,760
with the next release is the closest to

769
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,240
that where where we explain you know

770
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,240
every step in in more details what what

771
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
is it about and what you need to do and

772
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,120
which step follows the other and what

773
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,640
are the um impacts from one step towards

774
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,120
the other so there's going to be the

775
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,440
impact kind of impact map

776
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,760
for for for every viewpoint so so that's

777
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,520
probably the case but in general uh you

778
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,960
know when you say it's big

779
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,039
i think it's really trade-off because

780
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,600
sometimes if you take the pure

781
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,960
pure systema language and you over

782
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,120
customize it

783
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,760
it's really expensive

784
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,240
to maintain afterwards so maybe it's

785
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,519
better to take the bigger thing and just

786
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,840
cut it down

787
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,000
then to take the smaller and grow it

788
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,240
expand it towards your knees it's the

789
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
end of trade-off

790
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,760
and people somehow think about okay we

791
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,799
take simpler but at the end they they

792
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,799
have something like that

793
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,919
yeah speaking of susan l or tim do you

794
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,960
no

795
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,320
okay

796
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,760
yeah speaking of system l um

797
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,960
would

798
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,480
would system lv2 influence uif in some

799
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,880
reason so would you

800
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,600
would you change to system l2 and would

801
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,600
it

802
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,720
be

803
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,039
yeah

804
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,720
bring advantages which you don't have

805
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,919
right now

806
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,039
it would definitely influence heavily

807
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,440
it's just

808
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,640
the the question of time of how we

809
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,960
handle that

810
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,080
our current plan is to

811
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,880
have uaf we two

812
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,399
or faults y

813
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,960
compatible with the system lv2 um we we

814
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,480
would have a good match in numbers um

815
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,799
b2v2

816
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,240
um it would be clear what we're talking

817
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,320
about but

818
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,519
then then we need to think about how we

819
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,840
want to

820
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,159
to base uaf on smr2 because they can be

821
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,960
couple of different practices we can we

822
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,240
can take our conceptual meta model and

823
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,720
base it on the system our v2 and caramel

824
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,720
concepts

825
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,519
in in that case we would not

826
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,039
probably need the separate maintenance

827
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,679
of the implementation in the samal

828
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,200
and the other option is just to make

829
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,960
keep what we have and just add

830
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,960
additional uh

831
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,720
document to the spec which would be

832
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,640
implementation of uaf and the smlv2

833
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,840
um so we have to think carefully because

834
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,399
you know as is

835
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,600
they're not only small tools that that

836
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,200
implement uaf um and not not only some

837
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,279
other users so if we change the

838
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,679
conceptual meta model

839
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,200
uh for them uh that's that's the big

840
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,360
impact

841
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,360
because they have to move towards sml

842
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,720
where they're maybe more like business

843
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,880
kind of tools

844
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,240
uh business architecture kind of tools

845
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,159
and then for them that that gives

846
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,039
additional complexity on the other side

847
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,360
we also want to keep um

848
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,840
support for the system l1.x which we

849
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,480
believe will be at least for 10 years in

850
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,200
the future it will definitely be here

851
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,360
and many projects will will run on it so

852
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,360
we have to somehow keep this backwards

853
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,760
compatibility so at the same time we

854
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,440
have to maintain the implementation it's

855
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,279
a small we want

856
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,360
so it's really in considerations we have

857
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,880
to we have to think of how to how to

858
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,039
move forward

859
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,480
and and that's really you know the tough

860
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,480
work um ahead of us

861
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,279
yeah i think it's for example how to

862
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,960
maintain the the old version

863
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,039
for this movie one when you already have

864
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,039
the new version because according to the

865
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,919
omg policies if you have published the

866
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,519
new version the old version is not

867
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,519
not there anymore it's the same for

868
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,840
system lv2 as soon as it's officially

869
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,919
published there is no system lv1 anymore

870
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,599
so it's well it's not maintained anymore

871
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,359
but of course it's still there it was

872
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,720
published but it's not maintained

873
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,599
anymore no official specifications

874
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,599
it's complicated

875
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,560
plus in terms of a workload you know uh

876
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,720
like like with system we have

877
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,800
different teams working on

878
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,399
uh one.x right different people leading

879
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,079
the groups on one.x and on two um

880
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,800
so it's it's it's really you know the

881
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,520
big big scale you have to somehow manage

882
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,359
it

883
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,440
yeah yeah and i think

884
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,720
yeah and i think uh

885
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,159
when we are talking about a future uml

886
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:50,079
three i i really can't imagine that

887
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,679
omg says okay uml 2 is gone all our meta

888
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,879
model and and

889
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,440
whatever

890
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:59,280
uh things they are in uh until yeah

891
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,839
even until moth

892
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,160
yeah it's everything gone we have um

893
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,240
three now i can't imagine that one

894
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,880
and it's similar to this system

895
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,880
right yeah

896
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,599
yeah so you already mentioned that uaf

897
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,880
is stopped only for military projects i

898
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,040
can also use it for for other stuff

899
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,480
can you mention a few of them so what is

900
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:29,119
a typical use case for a company to use

901
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,400
uaf so i assume not for a normal system

902
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,920
so

903
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,960
so

904
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,599
what's yeah

905
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,079
i would i would say uif is a relatively

906
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,359
new standard just just look for how much

907
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,320
time it took to um really uh

908
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,040
you know

909
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:49,200
start using sesame which was first

910
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,280
introduced in 2007 right or 2006. um and

911
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,160
and and now we just see you know that

912
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,640
the heavy adoption in in industry uh and

913
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,320
for the first 10 years it was really

914
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,440
rarely

915
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,640
adopted just you know by some companies

916
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,599
with uaf um it's it's again

917
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,200
that the user base outside of defense is

918
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,920
not huge uh it's growing uh all the time

919
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,480
we we try to emphasize that uh one of

920
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,880
the things is the uaf group on linkedin

921
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,520
so i highly encourage uh for those who

922
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,520
are not on on on the group join it there

923
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,560
is community where publish

924
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,079
many many user stories

925
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,520
also you know the other area is the uaf

926
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,560
annual

927
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,680
summit which we started to do every year

928
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,440
in in march like probably five years ago

929
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,960
and we last year grew to 700

930
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,160
registrations

931
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,720
which almost like in cozy symposium

932
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,119
when it became virtual so that that's

933
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,720
pretty good attendance and we definitely

934
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,119
keep it to virtual or hybrid because you

935
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,599
know we we

936
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,359
think that it it's really uh pays off

937
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,040
and many people join

938
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,400
and and this is where we have you know

939
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,200
some stories to share um uh projects and

940
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,400
in the system of system engineering and

941
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,839
um infrastructure projects like electric

942
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,520
roads um

943
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,359
in sweden

944
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,560
there are some in in gas and oil

945
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,520
industry

946
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,760
um

947
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,720
electric grids

948
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,800
and then there are also you know even

949
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,160
if it's sometimes you know defense

950
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,599
industry but not specifically the

951
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,119
defense use case

952
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
so there are there are some on digital

953
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,680
transformation on the enterprise where

954
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,520
um

955
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,680
some companies find it

956
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,480
a useful tool like deloitte consulting

957
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,960
for example find uaf as a very useful

958
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,680
tool to do digital transformation of the

959
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,359
uh of their clients of the organizations

960
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,119
where you can define how you transform

961
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,599
the enterprise from one state to the

962
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,440
other and what resources are needed and

963
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,760
what processes are needed so that's

964
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,960
relatively easy it is

965
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,880
new new use case and and we did quite a

966
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,599
lot in the recent version to to improve

967
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,320
in this area um to define the drivers

968
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,280
for change the challenges we face

969
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,240
um the effects the outcomes such

970
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,839
concepts that we didn't have previously

971
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,320
in in the uaf and um that industry uh

972
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,960
wanted to have in terms of supporting

973
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,119
the the digital uh transformation topic

974
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,400
there are some also some some stories

975
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,240
from from automotive in this area

976
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,880
and we started some more collaboration

977
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,040
with the automotive uh and in

978
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,800
germany on um

979
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,800
uh autonomous mobility uh projects uh

980
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,560
within within the pro step

981
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,880
yeah so we we we hope we can um reach

982
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,720
achieve something uh in this direction

983
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,320
you know perhaps the specifically

984
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,200
adopted guidance

985
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,520
of the uaf and how you would use it so

986
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,119
so we're trying to to expand and to go

987
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,280
into

988
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,560
other directions uh

989
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,440
of course at the same time we still love

990
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,560
our um defense customers and we try to

991
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,079
do the best to them so i just don't want

992
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,400
to scare people

993
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,480
listen to this podcast yeah right

994
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,720
primarily still is still our industry

995
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,560
right so we we survive based on it that

996
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,720
the main people contributing are are

997
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,839
coming from a defense world

998
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,480
um but it it also you know i want to say

999
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,119
that we are looking towards you know

1000
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,640
expanding horizons and

1001
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,079
um towards the different ways of of of

1002
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,680
using uaf

1003
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,160
okay

1004
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,240
all right so that means so

1005
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,119
if i'm coming from a industry which is

1006
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,560
