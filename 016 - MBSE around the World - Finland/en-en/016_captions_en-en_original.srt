in which we visit a country to visit um

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,600
and to find out how mbse is used there

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
and in the past we have been

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,320
visiting

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,800
country we talked to rico samino about

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,600
mbse in finland

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,160
so rico welcome and it's great that you

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,560
so um my name is riku sarminen

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,000
and i'm an engineering management

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
consultant

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
and

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,759
my company

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
is

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
providing training and consultancy

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
services

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,040
mainly here in finland for for my

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
customers for my finnish customers

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,520
companies and and also

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
other organizations

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,600
and and the services

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,200
are very much based on systems

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,920
engineering principles methods and tools

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,280
and

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
my background

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,640
is from defense domain

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,079
i worked many years

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,040
for the for the defense material command

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,680
for of the finnish defense forces

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,759
uh and nowadays

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
people know that that organization has a

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,240
logistics

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,479
logistics command so new name but uh

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,000
but i think that most most the same

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,000
organization

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,520
and i i had a very unique opportunity at

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,520
that time

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,599
to to spend

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,400
one year at uh

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,280
studying systems engineering and master

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,680
of science degree in systems engineering

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,760
in in cranfield university

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,520
uk and and

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
that was uh

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,599
that was a lot of work but uh but i have

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,959
to say that i

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,640
i learned a lot and and i think that

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,640
that's probably

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,200
the reason why

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,599
why i'm i'm doing what i'm doing after

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,640
at the moment so so that's that's was

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,640
probably some kind of

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,200
driver or or major

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,519
milestone in my

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,959
in my life and of course in my career

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
and uh

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,120
after that i i continued working for the

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,959
finnish defense forces for the

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,480
procurement projects

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,599
and and also with the little life cycle

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,200
support of defense equipment

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,959
and

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,360
after some years

82
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,920
there i

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,360
took a position at the the other side of

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,200
the table as as you could say so i i

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,200
i started to work for the for the

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,400
defense industry

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,040
so i

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,959
it was also a good opportunity to see

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,120
see the other other way of defense

90
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,519
projects and

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,159
and learn learn the the industry side

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,720
and maybe that has been the

93
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,080
that's the the side that i have been

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,480
mainly working scenes and and the last

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,120
eight years i have been working as a

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,640
as a as a consultant and

97
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,519
and and trainer within my own

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,519
own company

99
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
okay

100
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,319
thank you

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
and welcome also from my side rico

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,239
um

103
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,680
yeah

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,920
when i think of sweden uh of sweden yeah

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,959
when i think of finland

106
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,720
i'm thinking of wood

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
and i'm thinking

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,680
of nokia

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,000
so

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,080
can you tell us what are the typical

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,600
industries in finland and

112
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,919
which of those are already used to use

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,280
uh systems engineering or even

114
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,720
model-based systems engineering

115
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,160
um

116
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
yes we

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
a long time ago we we used to say that

118
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,280
finland

119
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,560
lives from forests so so

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,720
we we had a big part of our

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
export coming from

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
wood and

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,280
and paper industry so that's that's

124
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,280
probably a

125
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,400
and and

126
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,720
it is still somewhat but uh

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,600
in general i think that the

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,880
the role of paper industry has has been

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,560
reducing quite a lot a lot in finland

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,639
and uh another traditional uh industry

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,759
area has been uh

132
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,639
and it still is ship building

133
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,639
so

134
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,520
so there was

135
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,120
some years ago a little bit

136
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,039
down

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,960
time for for the ship building but i

138
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,479
think again there are

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
there are uh

140
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,720
big ship building companies and and and

141
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,120
that's that has been

142
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,199
has been a a big

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,080
industry area

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,800
and as you mentioned

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,240
uh nokia was probably a

146
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,240
a big change in the in in the finnish

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,680
industry so

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,199
especially in in 1990s when

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,319
when when i when i graduated or

150
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,240
at first started at the end of eighties

151
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,880
and then and graduated

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,880
at 1990 so nokia was was very big player

153
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,039
and big employer

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,919
for for for the

155
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,560
for the people here in finland and uh

156
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,400
and those mobile phones and and and

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,319
networks they were

158
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
they they kind of uh

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,000
build up

160
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,319
uh kind of this kind of modern

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,759
technology industry and

162
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
and especially

163
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,199
electrical industry that that we

164
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,160
still have of course it's not a group of

165
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,720
much smaller companies but i think the

166
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,440
the people that that where

167
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,400
were trained and and and uh

168
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,479
work worked in at nokia are now working

169
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,960
for many other companies

170
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,080
so that has been of course had a major

171
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,560
impact on

172
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,400
on on finnish industry

173
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,720
about systems engineering and and uh

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
and uh

175
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,880
model based systems engineering i i

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,639
think that

177
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
it has been mainly

178
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,800
uh

179
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,720
that the traditional area of systems

180
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
engineering which is in in many

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,960
countries defense industry that is also

182
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,919
the same in finland so that

183
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,919
but also the the customer the finnish

184
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,800
defense forces and and of course the

185
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,720
other

186
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
other customers for the for the finnish

187
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
defense industry they are they are kind

188
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,440
of requiring

189
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,080
to you to use the systems engineering so

190
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,479
that is that is of course one driver for

191
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,360
for the defense industry and and

192
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,960
and lately there has been also interest

193
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
and a lot of

194
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,080
already

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,479
implemented systems engineering methods

196
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,960
and tools in in the nuclear

197
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,960
nuclear power domain so so personally

198
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,840
also i have been working there

199
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,080
there as a as a consultant so i can see

200
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,879
that they are they are really

201
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,800
really putting some effort effort on on

202
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,919
that part and

203
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
some other

204
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,560
domains

205
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,879
i know healthcare

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,479
technology companies they they are doing

207
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,759
some some some systems engineering but

208
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,120
but in in in general i think that um

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,840
that

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,120
we we have still still quite a lot to do

211
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,840
in finland for for for improving the

212
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,440
the awareness and knowledge of systems

213
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,879
engineer

214
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,879
and

215
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,440
what would you estimate how well then is

216
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,959
model-based systems engineering used in

217
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,279
in fitland

218
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,279
um

219
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,640
i i think our this is my

220
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,919
my personal view i i

221
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,800
i i'm not claiming that i i'm aware of

222
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
all

223
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,959
all activities of all

224
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,399
for finnish companies that's not

225
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,160
possible but

226
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,279
but

227
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,720
it seems that uh the finnish industry

228
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,640
has not

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,360
yet been adapting

230
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,839
systems engineering to their way of of

231
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,560
of work or model based systems

232
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,519
engineering to their way of work

233
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,760
uh i i know that uh in in the finnish

234
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,040
academia or universities

235
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,399
there are

236
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,360
uh

237
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,920
research research done in the area of

238
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,160
model-based systems engineering and and

239
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,399
i know that some companies have been

240
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,560
been evaluating

241
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,560
the possibilities of of model-based

242
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
systems engineering but

243
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,720
as i said my current understanding is

244
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,200
that model-based systems engineering is

245
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,839
not currently used

246
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,160
in in the atmosphere in in finnish

247
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
companies so i don't know i don't know

248
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,279
maybe i'm wrong but but

249
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,839
maybe if

250
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,760
if i'm wrong please please let me know

251
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,279
that that i'm wrong and

252
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,279
if somebody

253
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,959
in the fitness industry is already using

254
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,600
mbs just contact me and

255
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,480
absolutely or leave a comment below this

256
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,760
video and give us a thumbs up and don't

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,399
forget

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,480
yeah to subscribe to this channel to not

259
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,680
miss out any

260
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,680
other

261
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,000
podcast episode yeah rico um do you have

262
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,279
any idea why that is

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600
or why you

264
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,320
why do you have this feeling that it was

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,320
evaluated by many but not really applied

266
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,839
again

267
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,399
this is this is just just a personal

268
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:35,519
personal view but but i think that there

269
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:39,200
might be might be two reasons uh so

270
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,920
at least my experiences the the in many

271
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,360
companies and in many many industry

272
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,959
domains

273
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,720
the system architecture work is not

274
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,720
really

275
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
up there yet so so

276
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,360
it is

277
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,720
it is uh

278
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,399
not

279
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,240
done at all of course

280
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
you always have some kind of

281
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,160
architecture

282
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,160
but but you might not really be be aware

283
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,959
of it or you might not be documenting it

284
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,839
or analyzing it and and

285
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
and

286
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,440
or or you could just doing partial

287
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,079
partial architecture work so some some

288
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,519
architectures especially the kind of

289
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,360
speciality engineering areas like like

290
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,560
integrated logistics support there you

291
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
need to do

292
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,279
some some of the the functional

293
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,519
architecture views for for for that part

294
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,160
but but it could be that

295
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,640
those views are not then used for

296
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,560
for for other purposes

297
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,720
so it in

298
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,360
i i think this is kind of worst case

299
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,600
scenario but in in worst case you could

300
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
have different teams

301
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,560
in the same project uh

302
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,959
developing kind of architecture

303
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,120
views uh even same

304
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,480
view that and ending up with a bit

305
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
different

306
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,720
different results and not kind of

307
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,880
sharing it as a common

308
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,480
common view and and

309
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,880
and so

310
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,839
that might be the reason so without kind

311
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,440
of uh

312
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,600
an architect description a good

313
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
architecture description or at least

314
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,120
awareness of how to work with an

315
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,440
architecture

316
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,800
it might be difficult to start working

317
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,600
with them

318
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,120
with model based systems engineering i i

319
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,800
know that that you could also say that

320
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,560
that using

321
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,360
model-based systems engineering tools

322
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,320
and methods they that could help you to

323
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,160
start

324
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
start doing the architecture work

325
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,040
properly so of course there is that that

326
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,680
that

327
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,680
will be also so it could be could be

328
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
other way around also but

329
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,680
that might be

330
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,920
that might be one reason and

331
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,639
and the second reason is because you you

332
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
are

333
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,600
of course

334
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,120
advocates of of model-based systems

335
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,240
engineering so uh

336
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,480
i'm not sure if you like this but but uh

337
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,360
it might be that the second reason is

338
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,480
the

339
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,480
the high level of skills needed for

340
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,440
using the the current

341
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,240
mbsc methods and tools so so

342
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
it could be that the investment for for

343
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,519
skills

344
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,639
is considered too high at the moment so

345
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,160
of course

346
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,600
you you need

347
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,760
need to

348
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,480
need to kind of feel some

349
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
pain

350
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,160
usually before you before you kind of

351
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,120
make a decision for

352
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,519
for doing investment so so uh

353
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,720
whichever if you are doing process

354
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,800
development or competence development or

355
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,360
or developing methods and tools so

356
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,519
usually you usually you have to have big

357
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
enough a problem before you make the

358
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,800
decision that you you make the

359
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,120
investment and start doing something so

360
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,880
it could be that that people are just

361
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,680
managing with the

362
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,760
or coping with the with the current

363
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,760
methods and tools

364
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,959
yeah that would be interesting if the

365
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,279
the finnish companies don't feel the

366
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
pain or don't have the pain

367
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,880
to apply

368
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,240
mbs e so

369
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,040
you need a purpose to do mpse um and

370
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,959
maybe it's not not there or not the

371
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,320
pressure is not high enough for for some

372
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,440
reasons that's i think that's quite

373
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,959
interesting

374
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,160
and of course the investment is very

375
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
high

376
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,800
and it costs time

377
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,639
it's not

378
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,600
which time is also money

379
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,000
but

380
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,480
yeah you cannot introduce mbse methods

381
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,079
and tools in a in a single short-term

382
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,399
project or so that cost months or years

383
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,519
to really effectively apply it that's

384
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,079
interesting

385
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,160
yeah speaking of pain

386
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,560
if people work with mbse

387
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,800
they also feel some pain have questions

388
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,360
how to do this and then they

389
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,000
typically organize themselves in

390
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,720
working groups uh uh things like this so

391
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,800
is there a working group in the local

392
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,680
chapter of in cozy or

393
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,600
is there a local chapter in cozy

394
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,040
yes yes we we have a local chapter of

395
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,800
incosi

396
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,399
the finnish chapter is is called finse

397
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,959
so finnish systems engineering

398
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,760
association in english

399
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,320
and it's it has been

400
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,720
going on quite a long time already but

401
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,240
uh but uh we have

402
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,600
uh quite quite uh low number of

403
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,240
of of members in finca but uh but we

404
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,399
anyways we have tried to try to organize

405
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,160
uh

406
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,720
events uh

407
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,560
some events few events every every

408
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,199
year and and

409
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,079
and also this topic of model based

410
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,680
systems engineering has has been

411
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,320
uh

412
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,720
kind of raised by the by the by the

413
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,360
members and and that's that's something

414
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,720
that we have been discussing that that

415
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,759
we should

416
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,639
organize at at least some kind of

417
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,399
of of event discussing this this topic

418
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,120
but at the moment

419
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,240
there are no no working groups within

420
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,199
within

421
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
our

422
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,360
local

423
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,959
local uh chapter and i'm i'm not not

424
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,240
really aware of of any other

425
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,600
uh finnish organizations or that that

426
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,040
might have

427
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
have uh

428
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,839
any any kind of interest groups in in

429
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,560
model based systems engineering so

430
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,519
that is the that is the current current

431
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,079
status as as i know so again if i'm

432
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,079
wrong just contact me and

433
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,680
and tell me i'm happy happy to say that

434
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,920
i i was wrong okay

435
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
yeah

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,880
so question

437
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,880
uh yeah the one one area was was that i

438
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,560
i i forgot to mention was this uh

439
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,360
these um

440
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,320
these uh i i know that there are these

441
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,560
um

442
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,120
um

443
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,880
interest groups or working groups uh

444
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,720
related to to kind of modeling and

445
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,760
simulation

446
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,760
in general so so so

447
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,439
about to my understanding they are they

448
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,720
are focusing on

449
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,600
on uh

450
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,079
domain specific modeling not

451
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,400
system level modeling so

452
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,439
okay okay got it got it

453
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,000
um but of those few you know that who

454
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,880
are practicing mbse or se

455
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
um

456
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,840
what are the typical challenges for them

457
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,840
in finland

458
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
uh

459
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,280
i i think that um

460
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,000
you know overall

461
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,799
if you think about uh the the for

462
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,039
example that in cosi the finnish chapter

463
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,000
in cozy here in finland what what up

464
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,360
what is

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,360
what is our problem or or or

466
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,000
my my company uh

467
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
the kind of the the business challenges

468
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,559
for

469
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,720
for trying to

470
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,760
trying to to promote

471
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,440
systems engineering is is the

472
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,280
the

473
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,240
general uh

474
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,679
unawareness

475
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,160
of systems

476
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,679
engineering here in finland so so that

477
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,039
is probably

478
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,720
the the biggest challenge that that

479
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,799
it is it is very difficult to start

480
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,760
talking about systems engineering and

481
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,440
people don't have might not have

482
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,760
uh

483
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,280
idea of what what it is usually it's

484
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,919
it's they are thinking that it's

485
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,559
something related to software

486
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,440
and

487
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,679
and

488
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,679
so

489
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,480
i i know that there are companies that

490
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,440
have

491
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,360
good

492
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
knowledge and skills of systems

493
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,640
engineering but

494
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,559
overall it's

495
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
it has been a challenge

496
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,679
to to to

497
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,640
to start promoting systems engineering

498
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,840
um

499
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,120
of course

500
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,280
some companies are doing part of part of

501
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,280
the

502
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,880
part parts of systems engineering

503
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,120
but they might call it something else so

504
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,360
that's that's also one way to

505
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,760
start discussing about systems

506
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,600
engineering but um

507
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
that is that is probably the challenge

508
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,960
and that is

509
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,600
the reason why

510
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,840
myself i i am not

511
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,640
i am not a systems engineering

512
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,520
consultant or systems engineering

513
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,360
trainer by by name because i i have

514
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,360
chosen to use more general term

515
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,440
engineering management

516
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,480
so it's probably

517
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,240
much easier to to to kind of understand

518
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,080
that if we talk about engineering

519
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,880
management

520
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,039
of course it's it's not one-to-one with

521
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,960
with with systems engineering but i i

522
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,600
think it's it has been a little bit

523
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,160
easier for using using that kind of

524
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,000
umbrella

525
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,799
but

526
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,880
the the challenge for the mbsc i think

527
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,760
it's it's the general lack of

528
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,919
understanding of systems engineering so

529
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,720
i think that for me

530
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,799
model-based systems engineering is

531
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,679
systems engineering it is

532
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,400
kind of methods and tools for doing

533
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,720
systems engineering and and if if you

534
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,799
don't have kind of the

535
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,799
the starting point there if you don't

536
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,960
have understanding of systems

537
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,760
engineering then it might be

538
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,200
might be a little bit uh difficult to

539
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,880
to to start

540
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,039
start

541
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,200
implementing or even start discussing

542
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,960
about model based systems engineering so

543
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,240
that that might be the

544
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,840
might be the

545
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,360
the biggest challenge

546
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,360
for mbsc in finland

547
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,760
so well one action to increase the

548
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,960
awareness is to talk about systems

549
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,600
engineering

550
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,520
again and again so um

551
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,679
and well there's the nordic systems

552
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,440
engineering uh

553
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,679
uh last week the tour

554
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,640
was uh yeah we had the tour only

555
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,480
virtually uh so it was not the real tour

556
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,799
but um well you are one of the

557
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,640
organizers of the tour um as part of the

558
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
finnish chapters so

559
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,400
can you briefly explain the concept of

560
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,520
the tour and

561
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,480
report a bit of the tour last week

562
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,480
yes thank you

563
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,039
yes the

564
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,559
nordic systems engineering tour i think

565
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,039
it's a quite unique concept

566
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,600
uh usually when when you organize

567
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,799
conferences you you uh

568
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,880
uh select uh some kind of a bigger city

569
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,080
somewhere and and and bring all the

570
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,799
speakers and and and the audience there

571
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,880
and and uh then it tooks a lot of

572
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,840
traveling for for the for the

573
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,480
participants and and uh it might be

574
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,799
quite expensive to to to visit this kind

575
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,880
of conferences but for the nordic

576
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,760
systems engineering tour the concept has

577
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,280
been

578
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,679
kind of turned uh around so we we try to

579
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,720
bring the the speakers to to the

580
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,159
audience so so the the idea of the tour

581
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,520
is that that

582
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,280
we select

583
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,559
uh

584
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,679
several uh

585
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,360
good speakers several interesting themes

586
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,360
and and uh then we organize uh a

587
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,159
kind of conference tour

588
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
uh

589
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
for example

590
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,679
lately it has been like starting from

591
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:41,440
from helsinki then to stockholm

592
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:44,480
then to um copenhagen or or oslo and and

593
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,000
and even some uh

594
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,039
year we we also had poland and warsaw as

595
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,799
one of the one of the destinations so so

596
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,679
and and then

597
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,240
then the speakers have have the the the

598
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,240
challenge of of touring around and and

599
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,640
then presenting in every

600
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,960
every location and and uh the

601
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,520
participants have them a little bit

602
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,679
less traveling and it's it's easier than

603
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,799
for them to participate and also the the

604
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,600
cost for participation is is lower and

605
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,919
and

606
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,559
of course for us for for the finnish

607
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,840
chapter of incosive has been a

608
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,120
very um

609
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,000
good opportunity for for having this uh

610
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,640
this cooperation with the the the other

611
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,960
other incosi chapters because we are we

612
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,919
are a small chapter as i said and it's

613
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,720
very difficult for us to organize

614
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,520
big events so this this one is is is

615
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,720
quite easy event for us so that we can

616
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,760
we can kind of be part of the the bigger

617
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,720
organization and and and it provides for

618
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,919
our members a good opportunity to get

619
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,640
get the speakers all around the world to

620
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,440
to to to come to finland and and present

621
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,440
their

622
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,960
topics but uh as you mentioned uh

623
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,000
this uh

624
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,200
this uh pandemic situation has been

625
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,400
causing

626
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,240
some problems so last year we we had to

627
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
cancel the

628
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,120
the the whole tour

629
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,200
and uh this year we were planning to

630
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,440
organize it uh as a as it has been

631
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,799
earlier but then we

632
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,919
had to

633
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,159
have to uh make a decision that that

634
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,039
okay we cannot make a make a real

635
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,720
physical tour if there were two too high

636
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,440
risks of canceling

637
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,320
cancellations and and so on so we we

638
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,640
decided then to have a online

639
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,480
event and it was only for usually it's a

640
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,039
one day event in every country but did

641
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,720
now it was just one online event where

642
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,120
we had people from

643
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,360
from from different countries and and we

644
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,320
had four speakers

645
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,279
and and various topics and and

646
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,159
there were

647
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,440
around 100 people uh

648
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,520
joining the

649
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,200
the conference this year which i thought

650
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,039
was was really

651
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,120
really good amount of people and i i

652
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,360
think that there were

653
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,720
even people from from countries that are

654
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,960
not part of the the tour stops regular

655
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400
tour stops so i think that provided also

656
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,400
opportunity for

657
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,360
for those people to participate so i

658
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,240
think that was that was really good

659
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,799
so we had we had really nice nice events

660
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,000
so i think that even even though we

661
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,640
didn't manage to do it as as as we we

662
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
planned so uh i think the online event

663
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,120
was

664
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,600
was uh was still a good good event for

665
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,600
for for us and hopefully also for the

666
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,440
participants

667
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,520
and hopefully next year the tour will

668
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,320
hit the road again

669
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,159
and it will be a real physical tour

670
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,880
yeah

671
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,400
yeah i'm hoping that too

672
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,559
and christian it was also part of the

673
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,960
tour right

674
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,200
two years ago three years ago yeah but

675
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,440
unfortunately in this year we did not

676
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,559
have a stop in finland

677
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,039
we were in hamburg copenhagen

678
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,400
lynch shopping

679
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,320
and that

680
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,799
that was it

681
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,480
yeah i i think that finland became part

682
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,720
of the tour only

683
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,880
2015 so so we haven't been there from

684
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,880
the beginning

685
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
yeah

686
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,880
okay so

687
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,760
yeah

688
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,960
go on

689
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,000
yeah but uh as i said great event for

690
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,640
for for absolutely finnish uh in cozy

691
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,880
and

692
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,360
and its members so i think that that's

693
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,679
uh that's uh and we are we are

694
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,600
hopefully

695
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,240
kind of uh

696
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,320
willing to to to put some effort also

697
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,679
for the future years to be part of this

698
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,520
this this event yeah the two also

699
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,640
supported the the foundation of the

700
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,720
danish chapter in 2013 or 14 or so i

701
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,880
remember when the tour stopped there

702
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,880
uh there was during the foundation phase

703
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,360
of the chapter and it was very good for

704
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,679
them uh that they had already had a

705
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,520
systems engineering event then and uh it

706
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
was the same for the polish chapter so

707
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,520
it was very helpful for them so systems

708
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,760
engineering the chapter was very small

709
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,320
and poland was still this i don't know

710
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,240
um and was also very good for them i

711
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,799
think it was there twice in poland

712
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,399
that's great and there's another

713
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,320
tour in

714
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,880
southern europe the southern europe

715
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,880
systems engineering tour so that's the

716
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
name of italy spain

717
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,360
italy spain france and switzerland

718
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,080
yeah great and david long i think if i

719
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,640
remember correctly also tried to copy it

720
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,240
in in the us there was a eastern coast

721
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,480
tour so oh

722
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,440
east coast tour yes i think something

723
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,520
like that

724
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,919
yeah i think that the concept is very

725
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,279
interesting and as as we see there are

726
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,240
there are already

727
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,799
copies of it and i think that it's it's

728
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,399
we are very happy that that people are

729
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,399
using the concept yeah

730
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,279
yeah so great uh oh we yeah we have a

731
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,200
few minutes left so finally let's talk a

732
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,159
little bit more about you not about

733
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,120
finland and the two of us uh about you

734
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,120
so

735
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,840
you already told us a bit that you

736
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,360
are our consultant um

737
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,200
and so what's your daily job then in

738
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,520
system setting when you consult a

739
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,840
customer

740
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,919
yes as i said said that my my studies

741
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,039
there at frankfurt university was kind

742
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,520
of a

743
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,559
life changer and career changes so so

744
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,440
since then i have been more or less

745
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,279
used to systems engineering

746
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,279
daily in my work and and

747
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,919
last eight years i have been

748
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,000
i have been running this this small

749
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,000
small company and and

750
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,919
i'm trying to help my

751
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,840
my customers

752
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,679
using systems engineering and what i

753
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,440
have been doing mainly is i have been

754
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,520
working mainly with

755
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,279
with with requirements so with

756
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,720
stakeholder and system requirements

757
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,440
definition

758
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,240
and and i have done quite a lot of work

759
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,960
for

760
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,720
helping to define and building up

761
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,799
processes and and uh and tools for for

762
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
requirements and also configuration

763
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,880
management which are of course

764
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,919
important part when when if when you are

765
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,559
doing

766
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,000
doing uh

767
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,480
systems engineering in in general and

768
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,440
and of course

769
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,399
related processes so so when you work

770
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,640
with

771
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,799
with requirements as trying to capture

772
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
the the needs and

773
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,279
and

774
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,360
requirements so it includes also the

775
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,320
the architecture work that i i already

776
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,320
mentioned

777
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,240
you work also with the integration

778
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,799
planning of integration

779
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,600
activities and and of course at the same

780
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,279
time planning of verification and and

781
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,279
validation

782
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,760
depending on on the needs of the of the

783
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,919
customers and and uh and of course the

784
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,760
current phase of the of the life cycle

785
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,919
of the system of inter interest

786
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,200
whichever whichever system of interest

787
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,240
you are working with so quite uh varying

788
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,399
scope

789
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,240
scope of consulting

790
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,080
contacts consulting

791
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,840
activities there and

792
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,480
and then the other part is is

793
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,039
maybe not daily but but weekly

794
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,480
activities are related then to

795
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,880
to these

796
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,720
training courses

797
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,640
engineering management training courses

798
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,799
as we call them but

799
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,600
they they are based on

800
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,440
very much on on systems engineering

801
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,320
systems engineering principles and and

802
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,360
for that it's it's kind of a

803
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,600
regular uh entrepreneur work that i'm

804
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,039
trying to do sales and

805
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,600
and marketing of for the courses and and

806
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,000
practical hands-on stuff for preparing

807
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,960
the courses materials and

808
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,559
and venues and and so on so uh you can

809
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,640
you can do quite varying tasks as a

810
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,080
working in a small company

811
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,679
and of course then delivering the

812
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,640
courses in

813
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,640
either

814
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,840
online or or hopefully in the future

815
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,440
also also again at the classroom

816
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,840
it even sounds like it's pretty

817
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,440
plm related depending on where the

818
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,080
customer is at the moment

819
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,679
yeah that's that's true yeah yeah i

820
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,120
think that

821
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,200
that

822
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,720
i i always

823
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,519
uh

824
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,200
when you talk about the the the

825
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,320
kind of the

826
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,279
product

827
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,360
life cycle product information i i for

828
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,600
for me it's it's every everything is

829
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,880
related to configuration management so i

830
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,440
think

831
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,919
my right my umbrella term for for that

832
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,720
is but of course you need different

833
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,200
different uh methods and tools for for

834
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,880
implementing that that those those

835
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,600
configuration management

836
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,480
processes and methods that that you are

837
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,919
defining so of course you end up usually

838
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,640
working with

839
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,559
with with product data management

840
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,200
systems and and

841
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,880
and so on so that's that's

842
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,000
that's where you you do the

843
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,000
implementation part

844
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,120
okay

845
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,279
so

846
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,640
well i think time is up

847
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,519
uh

848
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,519
