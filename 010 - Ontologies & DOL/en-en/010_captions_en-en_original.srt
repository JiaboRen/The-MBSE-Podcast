00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,480
hello fellow systems engineers and

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:10,719
welcome back to a new podcast episode

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,559
we have a guest for the topic today

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,119
which is about ontologies and doll

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,640
and our guest today is fabian neuhaus

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,880
fabian would you like to introduce

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,519
yourself

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,199
hi um thank you very much for inviting

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,720
me my name is fabi my house

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,640
i work usually at the university in

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,840
marketbook and then could be the life

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,239
department

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,880
and i'm currently located in the

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,320
wonderful

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,280
city of portsmouth in the italian alps

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,840
where i am on a research project working

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,840
with colleagues here in

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,320
italy great so

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
and what exactly do you do at the

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,120
universities with magnavox or now in

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,399
bolton

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,680
well i mean i have the

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,079
mixed pleasure of teaching a computer

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,359
logic and uh theoretical computer

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,760
science but

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
uh my research areas are mostly in

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,799
ontology

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,640
all kinds of topics related to

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,680
ontologies

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,320
i and of course also

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
i was part of the group who developed

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,040
all i guess

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,840
that's also relevant for you inviting me

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,799
yes sure sure yeah fun fact

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
aside is that we are we three are all

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,000
germans

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,840
but we never met in germany only in the

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
united states at the omg meetings

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,439
well yeah so now we'll listen to three

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,640
germans trying to speak english for yeah

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,640
yeah so our listeners are used to it

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,079
like this laughing out loud shows also

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,719
so um so you're at a

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,880
computer science department but you are

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
not a computer scientist right you're a

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,520
philosopher no

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,719
indeed yes i'm a philosopher by training

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,719
phd in philosophy

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,319
and slowly migrated and i even worked as

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
a postdoc in a philosophy department in

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,360
buffalo for a while

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,440
and then slowly migrated first to list

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,480
which people might know as a

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,200
standardization

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,200
organization of the us and then came

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,480
back to work here in rugby book

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,360
and yeah so this is

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,360
why i have i mean ontologies are very

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,040
interdisciplinary area

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
not only because the ontologies

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,560
themselves are typical about something

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,080
else than computer science

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,519
right but also because

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,560
it draws a lot from logic from

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,720
philosophy um

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
well from other areas as well even in

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,319
linguistics

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,360
so that's you know by people like me who

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
don't really

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
originally come from computer science uh

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
often

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,519
migrate there and otherwise in the other

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,840
direction a lot of ontologists who are

74
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,599
really engineers or computer scientists

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,280
are very well versed in

76
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,640
uh philosophy so the very

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
interesting group of people who work in

78
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,560
this area yeah hopefully we'll

79
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,239
we are coming back to this philosophic

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,159
background of ontologies

81
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,200
uh in some minutes but um

82
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,640
a simple question to you uh what are

83
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
ontologies about

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,319
for somebody to explain it for somebody

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
who

86
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,280
never heard this term

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,080
well so there's an academic answer an

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
authority is

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,640
a fair specification of

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,760
some conceptualization and that's an

91
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,599
example for the

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
mission that doesn't help anybody

93
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
because

94
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,640
if you don't know what an ontology is

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,159
you you know for sure don't know what

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,120
the concept is

97
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,120
nobody knows that really and

98
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,239
so if i have to explain

99
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,879
what an ontology is i usually start off

100
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,200
with a glossary and say well think of a

101
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,120
glossary

102
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,160
and now you kind of rip the glossary

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,479
apart

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,040
in you know different pieces and because

105
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,919
you reorganize it completely

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,759
um so the first thing is you you know a

107
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,440
lottery typically has

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,919
um different is focused on terms

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,759
and ontologies are not so much focused

110
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,720
on terms but more on the concepts or

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,960
classes

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,759
that are important so you know

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,840
in in english for example you have

114
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,400
different words for sweets

115
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,240
right and uh well in the uk i think it

116
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
would be they would be called sweets in

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,520
the

118
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
u.s it will be called candy and in

119
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,759
australia

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
australian english it would be called

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,479
lollies and then the

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,919
glossary you might get different entries

123
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,320
for each of them

124
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
it's alphabetically ordered so the

125
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
glossary

126
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,880
typically is alphabetically ordered so

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
you want to find

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
s under s you will find sweets under the

129
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
l you find lollies and

130
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,520
maybe they're cross references and then

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,000
on in our ontology that kind of

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,440
the labels aren't that important but the

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,240
concept are important so

134
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,160
there will be one entry and we'll say

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
maybe it will don't even have a word for

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,840
it but

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,160
rather a number and say this concept is

138
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,039
called in australia

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,039
lollies and in uk it's called sweets etc

140
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,600
cetera in german it's called

141
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,759
and then french is you know okay so it's

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,880
called in french right

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,479
it's it's really the the concept in the

144
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,600
center not so much the word

145
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,639
okay and

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,680
can can you also say that uh

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,680
the relationship between those terms uh

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,160
are a part of an ontology

149
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,680
definitely yeah so the the the first

150
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,759
thing if you would want to go from a

151
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,160
glossary is kind of focus more on the

152
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,080
concepts and disambiguate

153
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,199
the the words and the next thing is you

154
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,600
basically order the concepts

155
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,360
hierarchically so you get a taxonomy

156
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
that would be in my opinion that still

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
would be an ontology

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,840
but that would be the next step so that

159
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,520
you you know

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,120
uh for example you would have a link

161
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,160
between the concepts of

162
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,039
um or the class of sweets to the class

163
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,639
of confectionary because confectionary

164
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,280
is the superclass

165
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,800
of sweet right and in different kinds of

166
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,800
you would have different sub classes of

167
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,280
sweets so basically instead of having

168
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
ordered alphabetically you get a in this

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,039
particular case

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,440
it would be a graph maybe a tree

171
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,880
structure ideally a tree structure but

172
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,919
most likely a graph of um

173
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,560
of concept and that's that would be

174
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,160
so that would be the taxonomy and some

175
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,759
people already would say taxonomy is

176
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,880
kind of an ontology i'm

177
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,880
you know well the borderline case and

178
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,160
then you would maybe add some additional

179
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,440
relationships like

180
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
you could talk about what are the

181
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,080
ingredients

182
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,000
right so you would have not just uh you

183
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,000
would have links between concepts like

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,639
you know the main ingredients of the

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,960
sweet is sugar

186
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,240
you for other things you would have

187
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,360
password relations

188
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,880
so a layer cake has different uh

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,560
belgian praline has uh has a filling

190
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,919
right um so additional information and

191
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,199
all of this things i should say

192
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,520
are not expressed just by you know

193
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,120
arrows on a piece of paper but in some

194
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
logical language so that would be

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,000
distinguishing

196
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,440
uh characteristic from

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,960
let's say uml diagrams

198
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
you know most of what i just said you

199
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,720
could do in the email class diagram

200
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,000
but the language which you're using here

201
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,879
is is going to be underpinned by some

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,120
logic the reason for that is that the

203
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,840
neonatology so just coming to what's the

204
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
purpose of it you want to have

205
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
interoperability

206
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,400
between not only humans and humans but

207
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,440
also between humans and machines and

208
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,880
machines and machines

209
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,000
so you want to capture the semantics

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,200
um in the machine interpretable way

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,120
so that is where i would say the

212
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
real ontology starts so everything you

213
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,399
know if you just think of

214
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
you start with the glossary so basically

215
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
you add the your order differently you

216
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
look as

217
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,839
you can look at the concepts you put in

218
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,760
additional

219
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,240
relationships and then you do all of

220
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
that

221
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
in the language which is a logical

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,120
language and if you have done that you

223
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
have mythology

224
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,080
okay so what what's the difference

225
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,959
between a concept and a term

226
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
is there a difference so you said that

227
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
that

228
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,959
sweets and candy is not it's not a

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
concept that's

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,160
these are terms in a glossary for

231
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,040
example and

232
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,440
now they're grouped in a concept but

233
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,880
where's

234
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,160
the difference between concept and term

235
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,200
well if

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,959
you have two sentences or let's say

237
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,720
we take bread roll

238
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,839
bread roll and butcher i mean for the

239
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,279
english speakers is one translation of

240
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,959
breadfall in german

241
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,959
so uh each of them are words in

242
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,399
this case different languages but the

243
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,519
express shared

244
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,680
something which is a clear concept

245
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,480
right that's the it's basically that

246
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,360
watch when you go from one sentence

247
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,120
if you went translate well you know the

248
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
justification why you choose that

249
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,720
translation and you wouldn't say you

250
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,079
know something completely different

251
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,160
is because you say well this one means

252
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,279
the same in english as it means in

253
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,440
german so

254
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,680
you can maybe i shouldn't use the word

255
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,040
concept i could have just said meaning

256
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,480
the problem is meaning is even more

257
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,680
weight

258
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,480
or problematic many

259
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,959
multi-faceted than concept i mean

260
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
concept

261
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,839
is hard to understand meaning is even

262
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,320
harder to to get

263
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,680
okay we could have a whole i mean a

264
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,040
whole podcast on

265
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,519
what's this meaning uh of the of the

266
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,440
sentence it's uh it's a very fascinating

267
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,240
and really multifaceted topic

268
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
so this is often and that's probably

269
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,560
also

270
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,800
you know sometimes people say

271
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,240
mythologies are used to capture

272
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,240
the meaning of the terms

273
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,079
and that's true and false at the same

274
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
time

275
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,720
because it really depends on what you

276
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,399
mean by meaning

277
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,600
okay so

278
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,279
let's assume we have an ontology

279
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,720
what can i do with it

280
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,839
well it depends it depends really on the

281
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,160
opponent you have

282
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,240
that's uh let's look at a particular

283
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,240
example so the most

284
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,760
successful ontology out there in terms

285
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,880
of users i think and also of

286
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,480
influence is the gene ontology

287
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,000
now the gene ontology from a magician's

288
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,320
point of view which i'm

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,160
more or less is a rather boring monology

290
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,399
because it doesn't have nice axioms it's

291
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,839
not very strongly exomatized compared to

292
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,440
other approaches

293
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,480
but it's it is successful because

294
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,480
um it's it's uh involves

295
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
solving a really big problem for the

296
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,000
biologists

297
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,440
and in still solving the problem um that

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
they faced when they

299
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
produced a lot of data so the the

300
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,040
problem they i mean in the 90s when

301
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,279
when they started to develop it they had

302
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,320
this huge amount of genomic data

303
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,959
right and every so you

304
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
you could look at the genome of mice and

305
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,320
of

306
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,959
various plants and of course of humans

307
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
and you

308
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,480
and you could uh find out that you know

309
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,839
this

310
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,000
genome is able

311
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,880
to express this kind of protein and

312
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,880
that's protein

313
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,160
placed in these roles in these kinds of

314
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,959
processes and

315
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,240
they were generating tons of i mean tons

316
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,760
of papers

317
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,519
and nobody could read these papers

318
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,600
anymore i mean there is too much

319
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,240
and if you were an expert in mouse

320
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,440
stuff you wouldn't be able to be to link

321
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
it to the

322
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,880
to the stuff which was done on plants

323
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,680
but the same genes are involved in some

324
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,760
sense of

325
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,279
the same and of course and ultimately

326
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,959
we're interested in humans because it's

327
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,399
all medically irrelevant

328
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,880
so in order to organize knowledge

329
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,800
they developed the gene ontology which

330
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,519
is a controlled vocabulary

331
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:15,680
which you can use to annotate

332
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:20,639
the literature and annotate the data

333
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:24,000
from from the very and

334
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:28,079
that allowed them uh first of all

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,079
to just get hold of the literature so we

336
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,800
oh fabian you're breaking openly to find

337
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,800
relevant

338
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,600
oh sorry but i can't do anything about

339
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,120
it yeah we know you're back

340
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,160
um okay

341
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,839
so the and but the the important thing

342
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,760
it was to them that they could then

343
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,279
automatically integrate

344
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,959
the various uh

345
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,720
databases they had about results

346
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,720
and without i mean each database

347
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,320
of this you know was individually owned

348
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,240
or whoever created it

349
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,639
and of course everybody has their own

350
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,680
database schema fitting for their

351
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,120
computer system in their environment but

352
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,320
um the andrologies allow them to

353
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,720
basically

354
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,720
integrate that data without having to

355
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,399
physically change them from it you know

356
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,120
the way their database worked

357
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,920
that was that was the next you know that

358
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
was the

359
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,320
immediate payoff and now they have tools

360
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,120
which basically just

361
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,959
automatically you know you you for

362
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,920
example analyze

363
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,560
um what kinds of proteins are available

364
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
in some

365
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,120
you know snippets of tissue and it will

366
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,240
automatically use that information about

367
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,720
what is there to

368
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,600
link it to the processes to biological

369
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,519
processes

370
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,000
which are mentioned in the ontology and

371
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,360
then will automatically tell you okay

372
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,279
what is going on

373
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,279
here and this so you you it's basically

374
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,480
now used for knowledge generation and

375
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,600
that's just one

376
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,000
one of many users so it's really

377
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,920
making data enjoyable it's one of the

378
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
main

379
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,279
use cases now you mentioned the example

380
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,079
of genes

381
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,880
i remember i i started to read a book

382
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,920
from barry smith about bfos and i think

383
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,279
it was

384
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,040
the example is it possible or do i mix

385
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,760
up things

386
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,440
um it could be i mean barry i used to

387
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,560
work for barry and i used to work for

388
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,160
barry when he

389
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,240
uh started the oboe well i mean

390
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,199
he was one of the many founders i mean

391
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,399
he's

392
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,560
he was the german told you expect

393
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,079
so it would be make absolute sense that

394
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,480
uses that example as well

395
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,480
okay

396
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
i think autologies are also used in the

397
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,680
context of

398
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,800
semantics web right so i think that was

399
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,199
the first time i heard of ontologies

400
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,720
yeah so the semantic web is an

401
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,240
interesting case for

402
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,440
when you have something in mind

403
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,880
and the idea fails but the

404
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
results are still useful so the semantic

405
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,079
web the

406
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,079
the idea was created the the original

407
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,600
idea was before google

408
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,600
and we didn't find anything on the

409
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
internet so the idea was basically you

410
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,079
would

411
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,199
put metadata on your on your websites

412
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:29,600
and then which is representing this

413
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,839
web ontology language and then

414
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,839
clever agents would use automatic

415
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,800
reasoning in order to decide

416
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,240
whether what you're currently looking at

417
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
uh

418
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,600
if you look for something that a

419
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,120
particular website

420
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,639
would be good for you you know whether

421
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,519
it has the answer

422
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,240
and that's original vision i think it's

423
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,399
safe to say

424
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
failed i mean google just solved that

425
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,320
problem

426
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,639
using completely different technologies

427
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,320
but

428
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,480
um but the uh first of all the

429
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,040
the technology was was developed there

430
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,319
like all the weaponry language of ldf

431
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,919
and other things

432
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,079
were suddenly used very useful so

433
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,959
partially used in the biology world but

434
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,720
also linked up

435
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,280
data was then the next development where

436
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,919
we said okay it's not so much about the

437
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,360
semantic web in the sense original sense

438
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,559
but more

439
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,839
linking linking data sets

440
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,200
so um yeah and in that case the in this

441
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,600
semantic web is you have rdf which is

442
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,600
represent just a way of representing the

443
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
data in forms of triples

444
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,120
and um typically what the iris that are

445
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,720
used in these triples

446
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,559
come are coming from the control

447
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,400
vocabulary that's

448
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,640
then an ontology but the ontologies

449
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,440
that you see in that domain and that's

450
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,280
why i said

451
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,760
said you know what you can do with an

452
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,600
ontology kind of depends

453
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,360
what how your ontology looks like the

454
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,440
ontologies that you that are used in a

455
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,160
semantic web are typically looking quite

456
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,919
differently

457
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,919
from the ones but

458
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,360
yeah and maybe um another question

459
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,160
before we come to doll

460
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,280
so we mentioned in the beginning that

461
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
ontologies have a

462
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:23,120
philosophic background and

463
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:26,080
maybe you can give us in some sentences

464
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
a hint what what the origins or what the

465
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,760
roots

466
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,880
of authorities are and why are they in

467
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
to fight in philosophy

468
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,360
well philosophers were always interested

469
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,400
in the question what

470
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,200
what is there and i mean the natural

471
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,200
philosophy

472
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,799
uh the inheritance of that natural

473
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,559
philosophy are now sitting in the

474
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,360
physics department still wondering what

475
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
is there

476
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,280
you know talking about string theory and

477
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
uh

478
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,440
and the of course philosophers in the

479
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,000
greek world like our startups didn't

480
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,720
really do

481
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,600
string theory uh but uh you know had

482
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
similar questions and then came up with

483
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,760
categorizations

484
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:09,280
of uh of uh you know what is there

485
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,760
and um these categories

486
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,120
um these the idea of categorizing and

487
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,400
thinking systematically

488
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,520
what categories of things there are is

489
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,760
um is something which helps you to

490
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,440
organize the ontology so you know

491
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,400
that's typically when i teach my

492
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,240
students uh ontology i start with them

493
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,080
telling them the technology like here's

494
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,840
all now

495
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,000
that's like giving somebody you know

496
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,160
chessboard

497
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,760
and say telling them yeah this is how

498
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,400
the pieces move that doesn't mean that

499
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,960
you know

500
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
really how to play chess you know now

501
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,120
you have just you need to

502
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,880
fill the ontology with content and the

503
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
question is always where do i start you

504
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,400
know where

505
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,760
how do i um how do i organize the

506
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,280
content in the ontology

507
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,000
which is and uh

508
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,440
so many people use upper level ontology

509
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,480
so called upper level ontologies which

510
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,200
give you kind of a

511
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,640
structure which you can reuse like the

512
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,720
basic formula

513
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,640
you mentioned earlier from barry smith

514
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,440
and the um

515
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,400
the the this this upper level ontologies

516
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,440
are typically

517
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,679
inspired from philosophy so

518
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,000
there is i mean i'm um also

519
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,840
i have the lofty title of vice president

520
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,280
of the international association of

521
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,400
uh consul for ontology and its

522
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,080
applications and

523
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,520
we are regularly uh organizing a

524
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,640
conference this year again

525
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,640
by the way um where

526
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,080
four applied controlledly and basically

527
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
a third of the people

528
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,559
or the papers that are submitted there

529
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,280
are usually more philosophical

530
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,679
and then other people looking more at

531
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,640
the

532
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,200
you know how do you apply this then for

533
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,240
more

534
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
you know specific so that's really an

535
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,720
interesting thing where

536
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,600
the more philosophical domain can

537
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
interact with

538
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,120
uh you know people who have concrete

539
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,000
problems

540
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,000
that they want to solve

541
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:22,400
okay um a few days ago i

542
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,960
i found a website about the iof

543
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,840
the industrial ontologies foundry do you

544
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,000
know

545
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,080
that one um it looks very interesting

546
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,280
i know of it but i have not been

547
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,760
involved i know

548
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,400
people who are involved in it but sorry

549
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,400
not

550
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,960
okay i know bearish this is involved

551
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,039
michael gruner got involved

552
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,720
okay so this is really a serious thing

553
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,840
i have things though okay it wasn't true

554
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,720
it looked very interesting but i thought

555
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,280
well just the website well the people

556
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,600
who are involved are definitely

557
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,159
very serious people yeah okay very good

558
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,200
know what they're doing

559
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,000
yeah there's also a subgroup

560
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,039
systems engineering so that's uh yeah

561
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,799
sounds very interesting

562
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:16,320
so okay maybe

563
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:20,320
we switch over to doll and uh

564
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,360
from my point of view i can use doll

565
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,840
when

566
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,679
tim thought about a concept and i

567
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,679
thought about a concept

568
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,039
and they have some links and we want to

569
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,280
bring it together

570
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,440
is this correct can i use dole for this

571
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,679
well if you just talk about the

572
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,240
individual concepts

573
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,480
i would just that that just would

574
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,400
typically that means you you want to

575
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,000
build an ontology together and then you

576
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,120
don't need doll then you built this

577
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,720
ontology together um

578
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,679
now doll is a language

579
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,320
a meta kind of meta language which is

580
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,280
designed

581
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,679
to be help people to reuse ontologies

582
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,840
not

583
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,840
to build individual ontologies but you

584
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,600
will use some

585
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,840
the problem with ontologies or one

586
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,280
problem with ontologies is that they are

587
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,080
typically

588
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,400
rather expensive to build because it

589
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,840
requires domain expertise

590
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:24,720
they are usually monolithic

591
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,360
and um that makes it hard

592
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,720
to reuse for them to be reused because

593
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,000
they're these monolithic

594
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:36,720
blobs and doyle

595
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,679
is um was intended to be used to

596
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,320
structure your ontologies to modify

597
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,279
existing ontology so that you can adapt

598
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,320
them for your

599
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,640
purposes and then use building

600
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,360
existing building blocks and them

601
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,480
together

602
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,520
two bigger ontologies

603
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,679
and um also define

604
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,200
constraints on the interaction between

605
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,039
different modules so that

606
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,919
when somebody changes one module

607
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,520
you can have checks whether this change

608
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,600
uh

609
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,080
you know interacts with the rest of the

610
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,840
modules in a way which is not intended

611
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,200
so that's that's um that's one aspect

612
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,240
the other aspect is that we are have

613
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,480
the situation that many more languages

614
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,279
are used in reality or in in the world

615
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,840
than just

616
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,320
owl or one single language and they have

617
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,919
good

618
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,600
good reasons for using different

619
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,679
languages and

620
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,840
doll also wanted to tackle that

621
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,640
basically enable people to

622
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,720
develop heterogeneous ontologies and um

623
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,679
models and specifications that's in the

624
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
title

625
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,919
right so the um but it's not uh

626
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,880
yeah if you think of something like

627
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,159
um i'm not sure whether you're aware of

628
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
the

629
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,559
time and date vocabulary it's an omg

630
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,840
standard

631
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,919
yeah yeah yeah that is

632
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,679
they also had that idea that we use

633
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,120
basically different languages

634
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,440
um um

635
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,760
definitely owl and common logic

636
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,960
numerical and class diagrams but also

637
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,679
sbvr

638
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,279
the problem there is if you just have

639
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,600
these languages next to each other and

640
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,640
modules in different languages next to

641
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,760
each other you don't um you don't know

642
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,520
whether they fit

643
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,200
if somebody changes something in one

644
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,320
module and somebody changes something in

645
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,919
the other module

646
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,520
there's no formal connections between

647
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,520
those i mean even

648
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,200
you even can have a problem within

649
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,080
different uml

650
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,919
diagram types you know if you have a

651
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,559
complex model using different diagram

652
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,200
types

653
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,080
that as we see the connections between

654
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,200
these diagrams is relatively loose

655
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,200
and so the one other

656
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,960
problem adults designed to tackle is

657
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
using this

658
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,440
several languages at the same time

659
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,279
modules in different languages

660
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,200
in the context of systems we currently

661
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,440
have the challenge now we have system

662
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,200
version one and now we work on system l

663
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,120
versus version two

664
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,000
so theoretical we could use dull

665
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,840
to define a mapping between social lv

666
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,840
one and this might be two or to

667
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,840
validate that the system will be one

668
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,840
concepts are also in system rv2

669
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,520
no because system l is not a very

670
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,720
compliant language

671
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,840
so dollar ism is working for

672
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,200
ontology languages or modeling languages

673
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,840
which have a

674
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,120
formal semantics because ultimately

675
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,360
about the meaning of things

676
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,600
the these constraints that you check

677
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,159
well you they need to be clearly and

678
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,480
formally mathematically defined

679
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,440
and that you do with the that you only

680
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,640
have with the

681
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,600
um if you have a formal semantics so i

682
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,679
know that there are

683
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,840
i mean there are parts of uml

684
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,000
which for which you have that it's not

685
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,200
part of the official uml center but

686
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,799
there's fuml

687
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,559
and the doll

688
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:16,240
standard itself has some

689
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:18,880
mapping from uml to

690
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,000
chrome logic which provides this form

691
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,799
former semantics

692
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,399
but as far as i know nobody ever has uh

693
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,039
tried to do that for the whole

694
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,840
system so in order to do this formal

695
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,520
mapping

696
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,840
you you know never in computer science

697
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,720
nobody you know you don't get anything

698
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,200
for free

699
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,720
you if you want to have if you ever want

700
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,640
to have a machine check

701
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,760
whether what you did is nonsense you

702
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,919
need to

703
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,320
formally declare what is you know the

704
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,480
meaning or semantics of your language

705
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,320
if you don't have that you can't check

706
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,200
you can't use these logical tools to

707
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,919
check it

708
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,000
so right unfortunately it's not that

709
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,880
easy

710
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,760
maybe we have to clarify what doll

711
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,000
stands for

712
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,799
i guess some of our listeners are not

713
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,720
aware what

714
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:10,159
omg the distributed ontology modeling

715
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,799
and specification language so arguably

716
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,919
the

717
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,559
acronym should be more complex but

718
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,159
you know it's hard to pronounce uh

719
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,720
pronounce it if you put all

720
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,720
the other letters in there

721
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,159
and it's an omg specification right

722
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,600
it's an oven yes it has been

723
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,360
it's an official omg specification since

724
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,840
2018.

725
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,399
and is it also planned uh that it will

726
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,720
be an

727
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,559
iso specification so some omg

728
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,799
specifications are

729
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,720
uh also iso no not iso specification but

730
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,679
iso standards

731
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,960
well let's let's put it this way we

732
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,320
started all

733
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,080
trying to do the speci you know

734
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,799
standardize the content of the dollar

735
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,520
standard in iceland

736
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,799
and we were so frustrated with the iso

737
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,840
process that we went

738
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,200
to omg so

739
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,279
i myself don't feel the inclination to

740
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,039
go back to iso it just

741
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:19,039
you know like

742
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,919
but there's a relationship between omg

743
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,279
and isola so many omg specifications are

744
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,720
iso standards

745
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,600
and that process is much easier

746
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,760
uh than to start from the scratch at iso

747
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,360
so uml is an iso stand that system is an

748
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:38,320
iso standard

749
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,320
so maybe could also be an iso standard

750
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,760
if somebody wants to do it fine

751
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,799
i i uh not i mean um

752
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,480
yeah it's it's really not my highest

753
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,240
priority really

754
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,559
because i mean ultimately ultimately um

755
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,399
you know i'm working academics so i'm

756
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,640
i'm kind of in the

757
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,600
in the business of creating new ideas

758
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,840
and

759
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,679
you know working on the same old ideas

760
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,399
is not very

761
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,399
appealing to me so um

762
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,840
and we're also non-academics

763
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,000
organizations involved in the dollar

764
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,320
specification

765
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,279
with the business interests in the

766
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,559
dollar standard

767
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:27,919
i mean the pure academic no

768
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,880
i mean the texting requirement or to

769
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,679
to understand that that you have support

770
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,399
of

771
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:40,320
of uh industry um i mean one uh

772
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,840
i mean i wouldn't want to start to list

773
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,440
them because i forget

774
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,120
and surely forget somebody and then

775
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,039
there will be inside

776
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,640
obviously mentioned in the omg standard

777
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,679
itself has supported it

778
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,120
uh but uh you know for example i to just

779
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,159
name one person because she was

780
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,360
particularly

781
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,760
as lisa campbell um he uh

782
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,519
you know this standard would have never

783
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,919
happened without her

784
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,720
he was extremely supportive and helped

785
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,960
us

786
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,360
and you know she's of course has her own

787
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,360
company

788
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,200
plans to use bulk

789
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,960
so they plan to use dollar do they

790
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,960
already have a

791
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,080
doll tool no i think the only doll tool

792
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,399
i mean the yeah the only doll tool which

793
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,080
tries to capture the whole standard is

794
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,559
something we developed in

795
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,360
macro book but uh that's an academic

796
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,640
tool that's

797
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,919
not um you know it's not something you

798
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,120
would

799
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,559
give out for into an industry so we are

800
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,399
hoping that that industry will adopt uh

801
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,240
solve at least parts of the i mean the

802
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,080
whole standard is really a little bit

803
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,240
challenging i think

804
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,360
i have to admit um you know things grow

805
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,000
but many import the functionalities

806
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,039
which

807
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,640
um allow you basically to

808
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,000
to support a modular development of

809
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,519
ontologies

810
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,840
i think is actually something which

811
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,840
which is not that complicated

812
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,039
implemented

813
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,799
okay maybe we can switch

814
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,960
to a question which

815
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,080
again regards systems engineering

816
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,200
because we are the

817
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,360
mbse podcast and we are

818
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,399
very aware of that you are not a systems

819
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,240
engineer

820
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,120
but yes um in in the field of systems

821
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,919
engineering you

822
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,440
hear the term ontologies very often and

823
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,919
yeah what i would like to discuss with

824
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,640
both of you is um

825
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,559
could be ontologies helpful for systems

826
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,480
engineering for example to bring

827
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,600
together the concept of different

828
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,519
engineering domains

829
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,720
or to bring together the concepts of

830
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,159
different processes in in the systems

831
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,399
engineering process

832
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,120
so could could that be a way to use

833
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,120
autologies

834
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,919
well to me

835
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,320
um so i'm working among other things

836
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,240
with

837
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,519
uh people who uh

838
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,080
well i'm working with the open energy

839
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,360
modeling community that's open energy

840
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,679
ontology

841
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,799
um so this is probably closer to your

842
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,399
community than

843
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,840
maybe the biology they are you know

844
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,720
like it says in the title they are

845
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,039
interested in models or energy systems

846
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,720
usually on the level of you know let's

847
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,159
say cities or countries

848
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:46,320
uh not much individual plants

849
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,960
and um whenever you have five of them in

850
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,720
a room

851
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,159
don't even need five we have three in

852
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,240
the room and

853
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,080
they try to communicate with each other

854
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,399
they use different terminology i mean

855
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,039
it's

856
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,799
it's just that's that's the fact of life

857
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,679
in all disciplines i mean i've worked

858
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,240
with many different

859
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,919
different disciplines just that's you

860
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,519
know anthropologies are always

861
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,039
you're always working with some other

862
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,320
domain experts

863
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,359
and um as soon as um they

864
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,200
i mean one important thing they they

865
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,200
uh you know the most basic thing they

866
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,960
have to do is create a scenario when

867
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,000
they're doing the modeling

868
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,639
and you know use the scenario

869
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,440
as input for the model now you would

870
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,200
think that

871
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,480
they would know what the scenario is

872
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,359
they could

873
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,560
you know it took them forever to come up

874
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:38,079
with the definition of the scenario

875
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,560
which which half satisfies

876
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,240
most of them and it's kind of important

877
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,359
for them because one of the things is

878
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,720
that they want to re

879
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:50,079
compare the results of

880
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,679
what they are simulating so the idea of

881
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,919
what is a scenario what's part of the

882
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,280
scenario what is parameters but how do

883
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,960
parameters

884
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,560
relate to the scenario although that

885
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,000
needs to be controlled if you have a

886
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,440
controlled environment to exchange

887
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
information about the results of your

888
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,480
modeling

889
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,040
models now i'm not sure you know

890
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,160
i assume that is the problem that will

891
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,480
resonate with

892
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,000
any um any engineering problem if you

893
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,839
have a complex product

894
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,680
different people model different aspects

895
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,760
of it people different people

896
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,160
story about different aspects right some

897
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,280
people design it some people have to

898
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,440
uh think about the components

899
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,119
get get the components others have to

900
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,720
assemble it all of that leads to

901
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,760
different perspective on the same

902
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,680
products

903
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,200
and all of these people have different

904
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,680
have an impact

905
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,280
incomplete view of the product and of

906
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,440
the whole process

907
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,480
and they have to exchange information

908
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,599
and

909
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,280
use different terminologies so

910
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,079
you always have that ontologies are

911
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,920
basically that that's the the main

912
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,200
purpose of ontology is trying to get

913
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,160
interoperability between

914
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,640
people and their computers with but i

915
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,200
think that

916
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,760
was a sorry tim but i think there was a

917
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,240
very

918
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,240
a very good example um with a project of

919
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,680
an interdisciplinary project with

920
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,960
different engineers

921
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:17,760
because it's exactly not

922
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,760
sufficient to just create a glossary

923
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,079
yeah but i asked myself how

924
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,760
how really can an ontology help them so

925
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,560
for example if i look at the roadmap of

926
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,800
this industrial ontology foundry

927
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,480
and the systems editing working group

928
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,280
according to the roadmap they

929
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,400
would like to pick uh iso standards like

930
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,480
15 to 88

931
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,320
that's a system changing iso standard

932
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,119
and 42

933
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,960
0 10 for example and create an systems

934
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,400
ending ontology

935
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,040
and so if i have a systems editing term

936
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
like

937
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,800
system architecture for example i can

938
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,880
look in the in the iso standard

939
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,560
and find a definition which is very well

940
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,000
not very helpful i would say that it

941
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,079
says a system architecture

942
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,440
are fundamental concepts of a system

943
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,560
which sounds true but

944
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,400
not helpful so what really is it and

945
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,320
now i can look in the system generating

946
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,180
anthology and then i get a clear answer

947
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,520
or how i i don't know how it would work

948
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,280
[Music]

949
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,800
but if it was developed by a clever

950
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
ontologist they would have

951
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,880
realized that that isn't a helpful

952
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,760
definition and hopefully

953
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,240
um put in a better definition but i mean

954
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,680
that's

955
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,920
you know obviously

956
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,359
you know that you don't need to you know

957
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,960
you could also improve the

958
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,880
quality of the glossary you don't need

959
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,920
an ontology for just adding a better

960
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,480
definition

961
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,680
not the the so

962
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,320
one reason why

963
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,760
glossaries often don't work especially

964
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,760
if you don't

965
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,520
you aren't in a hierarchical situation

966
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,000
but you have different people

967
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,800
who are not you can't tell people what

968
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,520
to do

969
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,640
uh is that people don't like to give up

970
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,599
their terminology

971
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,800
so an anthology by just not working i

972
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,119
mean

973
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,800
um let's say that people use different

974
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,720
terms for the same thing

975
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,880
of course in an ideal world you could

976
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,640
just tell everybody use the same word

977
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,560
and then you will understand each other

978
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,400
right but

979
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,520
that's not going to happen i mean

980
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,520
there's just people like their

981
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,800
terminologies and they are not you know

982
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,599
unless you force them

983
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,119
uh you're not and usually you don't have

984
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,040
the authority to do so

985
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,119
they will just use the terminology you

986
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,520
want since an ontology

987
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,839
will basically have an usually an

988
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,400
alphanumeric identifier for the concept

989
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,119
and then different labels you can have

990
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,640
in

991
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,920
the gui you choose the labels which are

992
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,280
suitable for for the person who's

993
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,000
you know working with the gui and uh

994
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,839
you know they they you can display one

995
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,320
set of labels to one group and another

996
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,079
set of

997
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,680
labels to other group and everybody is

998
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,280
happy they don't complain

999
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,440
because they see the terminology they're

1000
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,079
used to and they're still

1001
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,920
working together so this is purely on

1002
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,640
the human to human level

1003
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,920
but more importantly you usually have

1004
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,200
data associated with

1005
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,440
it all right with the with the things so

1006
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,320
you're using the you will use the

1007
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,240
control vocabulary

1008
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,599
in different ways either to annotate

1009
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,760
just the

1010
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,920
relational database or maybe you even

1011
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,480
have an um

1012
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,440
a graph database or you have a idf

1013
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,720
triple store

1014
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:37,040
and represent the in that case the

1015
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:40,400
triple store and the basically the

1016
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,440
ontology terms are directly in the data

1017
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,560
um so you by just using these

1018
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,480
um uh by using the

1019
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:54,000
uh ontology you can easily integrate

1020
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,040
the various data stats

1021
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,480
without you know loss of or

1022
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,480
without any problems but it's very hard

1023
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,340
to do that in an audio format it's much

1024
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,119
easier to show

1025
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:09,760
[Laughter]

1026
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,000
on the human to human level if i would

1027
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,520
like to use an ontology

1028
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,880
um it's typically by using a tool

1029
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:22,160
and i look in the tool to to read an

1030
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:26,000
anthology so it's it's not another pdf

1031
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,000
to find something

1032
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,599
typically your you your end user won't i

1033
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,079
mean

1034
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,240
you won't see the ontology i mean unless

1035
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,240
you

1036
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,040
i can't think of many reasons why you

1037
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,040
want somebody to see the ontology

1038
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,520
it's more that it's working in the

1039
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,280
background

1040
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,200
so the let's let's say

1041
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,880
let me give a completely different use

1042
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,040
case let's say you want just to

1043
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,240
use an ontology to support semantic

1044
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,760
search so

1045
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,640
somebody uses uh and let's say you have

1046
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,680
a lot of photos annotated with terms on

1047
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,440
anthology

1048
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,280
you're locking your the thing you're

1049
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,960
looking for is cute

1050
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,960
dogs right in the picture

1051
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,079
in the answer and so if you if you have

1052
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,800
an ontology behind it you can

1053
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,280
enrich it semantically by you know if

1054
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
there is

1055
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,359
any german shepherds and picture

1056
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,119
annotated with german shepherd

1057
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,119
that ontology knows german shepherds or

1058
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,560
dogs you can use it

1059
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,119
um you uh you know enrich the

1060
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,079
original search that is a very stupid

1061
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,000
use of an ontology

1062
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,599
in this case you don't even need any

1063
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,359
agreement or

1064
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,280
controlled vocabulary but that's an

1065
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,040
example of the use of an anthropology

1066
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,000
where the end user would never know that

1067
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,400
there is an ontology

1068
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,359
which is that you know the entries are

1069
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,079
just happy to see

1070
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,720
you talk whether that there was label

1071
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,440
dog or

1072
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,760
german shepherds didn't care right so i

1073
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,960
think

1074
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,359
usually anthologies are not displayed

1075
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,359
to be

1076
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,040
to the end user okay

1077
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:13,280
so we are already

1078
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,960
42 minutes on our way

1079
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:20,240
yes so 42 is a good time 42 minutes

1080
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,240
42 is a great number

1081
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,839
yeah so thank you very much fabian for

1082
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,640
being with us

1083
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:32,960
answering our questions uh without

1084
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,960
without

1085
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,119
yeah tim um what can we expect for the

1086
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,880
next weeks

1087
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:48,319
uh we have a

1088
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,140
an episode scheduled for may 25th

1089
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,560
if i remember it correctly um

1090
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,200
[Music]

1091
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,160
there's no title yet but we will publish

1092
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,240
it soon

1093
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,000
and you already know the guests and we

1094
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,160
all will also publish that soon

1095
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,440
and maybe we have a episode before that

1096
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,920
um so we have to figure out if you get a

1097
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,280
guest

1098
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,720
and a date um yeah so that's the plans

1099
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,800
for the next

1100
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,200
four weeks all right so

1101
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,480
don't forget to subscribe to the channel

1102
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,640
so you would not

1103
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:28,079
uh would not miss another episode

1104
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:32,560
and um so

1105
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:36,400
like always we just can say trust us

1106
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,800
we are systems engineers goodbye

1107
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,800
bye
