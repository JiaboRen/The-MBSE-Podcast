00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,040
hello fellow systems engineers

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,399
welcome back to our new podcast episode

6
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,720

object management group or omg

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
probably the best acronym ever

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
accidentally created

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
and uh i live in the u.s i'm up in the

23
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,879
seattle area

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,519
of washington state um where we hope to

25
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,800
see the sun sometime by april

26
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,599
and uh the my background

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,319
is actually i come from academia and

28
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,360
industry

29
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,640
and now i'm at the omg doing

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
specifications development

31
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,120
okay and well when did you come to the

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
omg

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,040
so when did you join oh boy um

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
i actually started as a member

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,680
representative

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
uh 2010-2011 um my employer at the time

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
was

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,080
a long-standing member of omg um

39
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,840
still is and they were the ones who

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
introduced me to the community as

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,319
uh as a member just coming in and and

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,120
working on technical concerns

43
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,000
um yeah they they're they're still yeah

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,319
they're still with us

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
and a lot of our a lot of our member

46
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
companies actually been around for a

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
decade two decades

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,760
um a few of them actually with us the

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,159
entire 32 years

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,760
uh anyway i was a member um i chaired

51
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,040
the architecture

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,480
driven modernization task force and

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,400
wrote co-authored a couple of

54
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,159
specifications um

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,640
then i was elected to the architecture

56
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,599
board which is an oversight board within

57
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,400
the omg and all of this is as a member

58
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,440
and then

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,720
in october of 2019

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,360
omg the organization to actually come on

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,920
board as an employee

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,080
and i have to say it's been a very

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,120
interesting 14 months on the job

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
absolutely almost nothing about the

65
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
organization

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,360
is the same as when i started um yet

67
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
we've worked exceedingly hard to make

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
sure that the uh

69
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,840
the essentials and the critical elements

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
have endured through all of this

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,799
in our transparency and our processes

72
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,680
and

73
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,400
fidelity of technical excellence and all

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,560
that is

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,759
has absolutely maintained through all of

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
this but

77
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,919
yeah i've been uh i've been with omg in

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,960
various capacities for just about 10

79
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,280
years

80
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,800
i loved every minute so

81
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
what we like to show our listeners today

82
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
is

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,000
how omg works but before that

84
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,040
maybe you can describe

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,400
one one more time what the omg is and

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:05:01,120
what the omg does

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,840
uh jason i fear we lost your audio

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:11,840
yeah we can see you very well but we

89
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,840
cannot hear you

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,520
still not

91
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
of course no

92
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,360
well it worked all the time but yeah

93
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,360
worked half an hour before

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,960
so i think we need a new screen uh

95
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,960
solving to have technical issues so

96
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,120
well trust us is that better oh much

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,160
better much better

98
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,440
so you can hear me now yes yes

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
excellent okay

100
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,360
it's always a technical difficulty

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,479
somewhere along the lines in there

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,759
so uh what is the omg

103
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,880
um omg is actually uh well

104
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,960
clear something up there are two

105
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,440
entities that operate as the omg

106
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,800
uh and they you'll hear them both

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,919
referred to by that name so just to

108
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,479
clear it up real quick

109
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,960
uh first is the community that i'm here

110
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
to

111
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,800
mostly talk about with you today which

112
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,919
is the specifications development

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
organization or

114
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,479
sdo uh

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,240
a lot of people would refer to it as a

116
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,600
standards development organization but

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
there's a distinction there we can

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
talk about later most sdos have a focus

119
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,240
including ours

120
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,680
ours happens to be on modeling and

121
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,960
ontologies

122
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,400
so uh ways to describe complex systems

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,560
such that they can be

124
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,160
expressed precisely communicated with

125
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,560
others and reasoned about

126
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,880
in in formal ways um we're kind of the

127
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
the watering hole in the oasis on the

128
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,759
savannah where all of the animals come

129
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,160
together

130
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,039
uh we're the neutrals area where

131
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,199
competitors

132
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,080
in industry come together to collaborate

133
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,120
and work on

134
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,599
common solutions to common problems the

135
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,080
second

136
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,039
omg entity is the organization as a

137
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,080
whole

138
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,319
and the originally the organization

139
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,160
and the sdo were one of the same but

140
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,639
over time we realized that

141
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
we're actually rather good at creating

142
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
and supporting communities

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,599
and we had other communities pop up in

144
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,599
2010 we had

145
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,440
sisk the consortium for information

146
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,800
software quality

147
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,919
and they work closely with the sdo to

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,360
create and shepherd specifications into

149
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,479
our system

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,240
we also in 2014 we had the industrial

151
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,280
internet consortium which is sort of an

152
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,840
industrial iot

153
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,120
group uh 2019 we had dds foundation data

154
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,319
distribution services

155
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,840
foundation as well as bpm plus health

156
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,840
for business process modeling in the

157
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,960
healthcare space and last year we

158
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,120
launched the digital twin consortium

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,280
which is everything to do with digital

160
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,520
twins simulation prediction

161
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
uh calibration synchronization all that

162
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,360
good stuff

163
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,120
so we're really now we're a community of

164
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
communities we're a whole ecosystem

165
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,360
around this

166
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,120
and the sdo operates as the uh sort of

167
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,800
the linchpin in a lot of ways

168
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,879
for uh specifications and

169
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
providing process support to the other

170
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,199
communities

171
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,919
when they have something that they would

172
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,120
like to to get out there into industry

173
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,800
in a more formal way

174
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
all of our communities are volunteer

175
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,080
based

176
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,839
they're the ones who make it all happen

177
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,719
we say that we are a member-driven

178
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,480
organization

179
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:48,160
and we mean that very very clearly and

180
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,320
and precisely um everything that happens

181
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,640
at omg happens through our membership

182
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,160
uh whether it is deciding the policies

183
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,320
and procedures

184
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,000
or determining what the shape of our

185
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,080
conferences are going to be

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and every bit of technical work that is

187
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,880
done at omg is done

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,800
by our our membership omg the

189
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
organization simply provides the space

190
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,080
for them to do that and the support

191
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,480
for their communities but it's uh

192
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,200
everything that that is published by omg

193
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,480
in the end

194
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,519
actually originates from our membership

195
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,440
and how many members are under omg

196
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,399
we have over 300 members right now and

197
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,120
we have

198
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,320
what we have is member companies some

199
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,000
organizations have

200
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,399
individual members we only have

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,440
companies as members

202
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,880
we have i think it's a just shy of 350

203
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,200
actually at the moment

204
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,480
but uh they range in size from you know

205
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,640
international global con

206
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
you know conglomerates down to single

207
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,760
individual consultancies

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:56,000
uh and they are everywhere in the world

209
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,160
okay and yeah tim go on

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,399
the omg has branches in other countries

211
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,399
i remember in germany there was

212
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,640
an organization that they said they are

213
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,120
the omg or responsible for

214
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
stuff and uh did a lot of obg

215
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,519
information days

216
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,399
uh so one day conferences yeah we

217
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
actually have

218
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,839
we have groups that we work with all

219
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,200
around the globe

220
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,920
the we have representatives and uh

221
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
uh sort of satellite offices pretty much

222
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
everywhere

223
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,920
um i think we're i think we're actually

224
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
in six of the seven continents and i

225
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
keep hoping for antarctica but nothing

226
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
yet

227
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:36,079
so okay and then you mentioned

228
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,320
uh an interesting fact so you said

229
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,279
omg is a standards development

230
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,880
organization

231
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,040
so what is what is

232
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,240
the difference between standards and

233
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,880
specifications

234
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
or is that different there's actually a

235
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,200
that's a good question

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,800
um there is a distinction in a in a very

237
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,079
technical and legal sense

238
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,360
standards are uh adopted by

239
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,839
nation states countries so like iso

240
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,640
international standards organization

241
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,079
their membership

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,079
are nations they're not companies

243
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,680
they're not individuals they're actually

244
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:15,120
nations so a standard is

245
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,320
one that has been adopted by a a

246
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,640
national government body um

247
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,480
otherwise it's a technical specification

248
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,360
it's a technical document that has been

249
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,920
adopted by a community or an industry

250
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
and you know of course informally most

251
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,560
people

252
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,480
will refer to specifications as

253
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,519
standards you know the html standard

254
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,440
or you know uh what have you um

255
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,360
but there actually is a distinction so

256
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,079
when we talk about

257
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,000
uh what we produce we try and always try

258
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,320
and always use the word specifications

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
but

260
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,000
sometimes we slip out and refer to them

261
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,920
as standards

262
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
but yeah correctly their specifications

263
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,720
okay and some omg technologies

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
are also iso standards right so yeah i

265
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,079
think

266
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,079
uml and system i know that for sure

267
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,480
uh so what's the relationship between

268
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,600
obg and iso

269
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,800
so we have um i think the current count

270
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,399
is 13

271
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,240
specifications that have been ratified

272
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,079
as iso standards

273
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,720
and we have a bit of a special

274
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,920
relationship between omg and iso

275
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
um what uh what we've done over the

276
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,800
years

277
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,600
is work closely closely with iso to make

278
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,399
sure that

279
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,920
what we do is more or less iso

280
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,000
conformant

281
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
if you look at an omg published

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
specification

283
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,760
the the format the document etc it is

284
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
the iso format

285
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,120
in fact if you take if you grab one of

286
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
the

287
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
the omg's specifications for like uml or

288
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,959
ssml

289
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,639
off of our website and you then go to

290
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,200
the iso

291
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,560
site and pay for theirs ours are free

292
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,760
there's a paid

293
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,959
uh the only difference is the cover page

294
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,920
that's it everything else is exactly the

295
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,519
same

296
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,720
so it's uh um yeah we work extremely

297
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,800
closely with them we have

298
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,240
what is uh called a publicly accessible

299
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
standard status

300
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,839
which means that they have vetted our

301
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
processes uh they have taken a look at

302
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,880
the quality of

303
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,720
our output over the years and we're

304
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,279
essentially on a fast track

305
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,000
so if we take our specifications into

306
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,040
iso

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,680
um we have a uh

308
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,040
a unique position within the within

309
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,079
their processes

310
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,240
and frequently it's a six to nine month

311
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,040
process to get one of our specifications

312
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,480
through

313
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,199
iso in fact we tend to be so much faster

314
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,639
than they are

315
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,399
that our process time plus

316
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
getting the fast track time is usually

317
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,199
less than their

318
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:53,040
regular process time so

319
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,040
it's uh it's an option for some people

320
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,320
so they never do changes to the

321
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,160
specifications except

322
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
the cover sometimes they do sometimes

323
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,680
they do there are sometimes minor

324
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,800
requests that are made um but uh

325
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,480
yeah for the most part it's it's exactly

326
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,920
the same document

327
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,600
yeah okay and

328
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,000
so let's let's go a little bit deeper

329
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
into how how omg works so one

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
one of the places where these

331
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,399
specifications

332
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,240
are worked out is a technical meeting

333
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,240
can you explain to other listeners what

334
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,639
a technical meeting is

335
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,079
sure so a technical meeting is a

336
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
conference that happens four times a

337
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,160
year

338
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,399
um used to be face to face this year has

339
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,680
been a little challenging

340
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,600
uh but uh we have you know we have

341
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,000
adapted to the new environment and we've

342
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,800
been running virtual conferences

343
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,560
they are a week long they run from

344
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,079
monday through friday

345
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,760
and actually if you don't mind i have

346
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,320
some slides here that i can

347
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,959
you know show and and demonstrate a

348
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
little bit

349
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,240
of uh

350
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,440
what it looks like as far as from a

351
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,040
structural viewpoint because that's

352
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,880
really sort of the

353
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,160
that's really important to understanding

354
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,360
what goes

355
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,320
on during this conference week

356
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,639
from the evening sessions all right no

357
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,639
no no

358
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,040
yeah it's a it's a very interesting it's

359
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,079
a very interesting time i will say that

360
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,920
uh

361
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,839
coming from academia industry this is

362
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,959
omg is the most interesting confluence

363
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,079
of the two

364
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,040
approaches i've ever seen it has the the

365
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,399
idealistic

366
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,600
and uh uh you know let's do incredible

367
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,279
things of academia

368
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,959
and it has the pragmatic we need to get

369
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,320
things done of industry all over the

370
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,920
same place and it's it's fantastic but

371
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:47,199
uh this is the this is the structure of

372
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,199
uh omd as a as an sdo um

373
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,959
and we have the from the top down we

374
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,240
have the board of directors which is our

375
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,000
our business oversight uh they are

376
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
elected from our membership we have the

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,560
architecture board which is

378
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,399
a technical oversight board again

379
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,440
elected from the membership

380
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,880
uh we then have a split between our two

381
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
technology committees domain and

382
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,639
platform and domain

383
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,360
is uh focused on specific industries

384
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,360
such as

385
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,839
finance healthcare space exploration

386
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680
uh one that's near and dear to my heart

387
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,800
you might notice in the background

388
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,920
um just a ton of uh of

389
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,959
uh very industry focused task forces and

390
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
then on the other side we have the

391
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,440
platforms which

392
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,120
are analysis and design um artificial

393
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,680
intelligence these are technologies

394
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
and concepts that cross-cut across a

395
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,680
number of industries

396
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,639
so these task force organization lets

397
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,120
you

398
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,320
let you focus on specific industries or

399
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,800
on horizontal

400
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,800
technologies the

401
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,519
the task force is meet all week um

402
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,880
and they uh they will discuss their

403
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,639
particular agendas

404
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,639
um if they have documents that need to

405
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,959
be reviewed they will bring them to

406
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,759
the architecture board for review during

407
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,360
the week

408
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,439
the architecture board will then

409
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,120
recommend whether or not a

410
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,120
um a

411
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,480
documented technology something should

412
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,839
be recommended it will go back to the

413
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,439
technology committee

414
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,120
and they will actually vote on whether

415
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,720
to move it forward um

416
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,160
it's kind of a bit of a back and forth

417
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,120
and and we can go into that later if

418
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,480
you'd like

419
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,000
but um yeah it's it's four days of

420
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,880
everybody running around bouncing from

421
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
meeting admitting

422
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,799
making sure that they're collaborating

423
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,919
and in our communication with each other

424
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,559
and then on friday everything comes

425
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,640
together

426
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,080
and we have the plenary session which is

427
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,880
where the technical committees meet and

428
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,559
do the final

429
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,080
votes and and move things forward

430
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,600
that's always kind of an interesting day

431
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,720
because you get to see everything that

432
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,640
has happened that week

433
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,480
and everything that is going to be

434
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
happening at the next meeting

435
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
uh it's a wonderful way of kind of

436
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,000
catching up and getting prepared for the

437
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,280
next cycle

438
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,640
um and we have a uh webinar actually

439
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,720
tomorrow

440
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
that uh we're going to be doing that so

441
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,840
if anybody's interested to find out more

442
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,480
uh hop over to the omg.org website and

443
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
we will

444
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,679
uh you can find the link there for uh

445
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,400
yeah

446
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,720
we'll be talking tomorrow cool so very

447
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,720
good

448
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
maybe as a side information for our

449
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,520
german listeners so we have

450
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,600
even a german board of director member

451
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,840
so uber kaufman is on the board of

452
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,640
directors

453
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,559
maybe listeners know him

454
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,880
and you mentioned also the architecture

455
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,280
board and i think it's an interesting

456
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,480
fact

457
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:42,160
what uh yeah

458
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,120
what requirements are prerequisites are

459
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,559
set for

460
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:50,000
architecture member boards uh people

461
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,640
so yeah so the architecture board is

462
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,919
um it's a wonderful group of people

463
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,840
these are

464
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,120
individuals who have been nominated by

465
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,520
their peers within the group

466
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,840
to basically represent omg's

467
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,559
technical review so it's

468
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,160
um they look at they do a technical

469
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,520
oversight they look at every document

470
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,520
that comes through

471
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,120
they make sure that it fits sort of

472
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,080
within our larger specification

473
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,000
ecosystem

474
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,679
so that we don't have groups that are

475
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,440
stepping on each other's toes

476
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,120
or you know we're not leaving gaps

477
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,240
within our ecosystem we want to make

478
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,280
sure that

479
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,320
that uh what comes out is

480
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,520
fit to purpose and is also

481
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,600
uh high quality um

482
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,360
so it's a it tends to be a bit of a

483
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,200
gauntlet for folks coming through

484
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,280
uh and christian i know you've you've

485
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,200
been through it

486
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,200
yeah um it these are exceedingly bright

487
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,000
people but it's they're nominated by

488
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,080
their peers

489
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
and they're elected by their peers there

490
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,240
are five architecture board members

491
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,919
from the domain technical committee and

492
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,440
five from the platform technical

493
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,520
committee

494
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,960
uh they put a tremendous amount of time

495
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,640
and effort into

496
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,000
into every meeting cycle um but uh yeah

497
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,360
we have an election every year

498
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,720
and it's it's a good group it's a lot of

499
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,520
fun i'm the chair of the architecture

500
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,000
board

501
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:23,200
and uh it's it's a task i greatly enjoy

502
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,280
okay so is it true that they need a

503
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,559
confirmation letter of their companies

504
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,600
that they get spare time

505
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,080
for their work yeah actually it's

506
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,880
they dedicate so much time that one of

507
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,799
the

508
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,320
one of the things that we require is a

509
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,240
letter from their employer

510
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,640
saying that they are allowed to use up

511
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,360
to 25

512
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,720
of their official employment time to

513
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,080
work on this

514
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,200
um it's it's a lot i mean when you

515
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,039
have well my first

516
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,039
meeting as an architecture board member

517
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,679
my very first document was

518
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,640
a 1600 page specification in a domain

519
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,000
that i had never

520
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,480
worked in

521
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
i don't think they were hazing me but

522
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
i'm still not sure

523
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,480
it was it was a couple of uh

524
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,159
it was a couple of weeks of dedicated

525
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,520
effort to get through that document and

526
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,520
give it the

527
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,960
the uh attention to detail that it

528
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,840
needed um

529
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,320
it's it's a ton of work and it continues

530
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,799
on

531
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,679
even after the meetings uh right now we

532
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,679
have

533
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,679
multiple architecture board members who

534
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,080
are working with groups to

535
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,520
make sure that their uh their documents

536
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
and what they're producing is of

537
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,120
top-notch quality

538
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,200
and uh meshes well with everything else

539
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,720
that we have

540
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,600
right um coming back to the technical

541
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,720
meetings so where are the meetings held

542
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,840
in most cases right now

543
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,640
right now eventually okay yeah

544
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
um so every march we try and have a

545
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,520
meeting

546
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,880
in western virginia in the washington dc

547
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,760
area

548
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
and that's sort of our our one uh

549
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,200
regular

550
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,880
meeting location um every december we

551
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,679
try and do one on the west coast of the

552
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,280
us

553
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,280
uh usually california june and september

554
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,520
kind of bounce around

555
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,640
june alternates between somewhere in

556
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,679
north america and

557
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,640
somewhere in europe and then september

558
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,200
is free floating

559
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,280
it could be anywhere any year and we

560
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,640
leave that one wide open

561
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,320
but we try and hit the at least major

562
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,159
geographic areas

563
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,520
um we're talking about getting back to

564
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,080
asia which

565
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,840
about 10 years ago was was one of our

566
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,640
regular locations

567
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,760
um i believe june was actually

568
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,039
alternating between

569
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,360
europe and asia previously

570
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,159
um but yeah right now it's it's north

571
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,679
america and europe

572
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,360
although we really would love to expand

573
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,880
that back out again once

574
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,880
travel becomes possible

575
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
what was your favorite meeting location

576
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,679
ever oh probably brussels

577
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,520
brussels it was a nice meeting i

578
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,480
remember that one it was a nice meeting

579
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,520
it was

580
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,280
uh the uh that was one that my

581
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,760
that uh my wife was able to accompany me

582
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,840
on and gotten married the year before

583
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,400
so we had a few days in paris beforehand

584
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,600
and it was a good prep

585
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,960
yeah my highlight was nashville so i

586
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,120
loved the nashville meeting

587
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,080
with all the music in the top in

588
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,520
downtown

589
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,520
yeah it was great

590
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,039
nashville was a lot of fun

591
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,360
okay so but coming back to the

592
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,559
specification process

593
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,320
it's also a lot of fun well

594
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,200
i think it's more fun than that people

595
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,440
expect um

596
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,320
yeah the workflow it's very interesting

597
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,360
it's it's

598
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,799
the best training you'll learn a lot

599
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,279
um so uh

600
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,200
last year yes was last year we had a

601
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,159
german episode in this podcast about

602
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,880
the history of system so maybe that's

603
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,760
that's a good

604
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,279
example to explain the omg process so in

605
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,799
that episode we used a lot of

606
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:15,919
abbreviations like rfe rfp

607
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,880
and so on but we did not explain them

608
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,679
so it's maybe it's time to explain them

609
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,000
now

610
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:27,440
um if i remember correctly it was 2002

611
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,200
um when the omg published the request

612
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,159
for information the rfi

613
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,720
for uml for systems engineering also

614
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,919
known as

615
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,640
systematic so is is that the starting

616
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
point

617
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,440
uh of of a specification development and

618
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,880
and who starts the request for

619
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,720
information

620
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,240
it can be uh do you mind if i share my

621
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,760
screen again yes

622
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,120
please okay so

623
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,360
there's really five phases of

624
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,480
uh what happens with a specification at

625
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,559
omg

626
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,240
and we like to think of this as a

627
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
conversation this is a conversation

628
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,240
that's happening between

629
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,320
industry between our membership and

630
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,840
between the organization

631
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,600
and the very first thing you have to do

632
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,440
in getting towards the specification is

633
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,960
ask what's the problem

634
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,200
and so if there's you know a market

635
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,240
awareness of a problem or you know

636
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,840
problem arises in industry um

637
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
people could become aware of the problem

638
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,480
but they're really not quite sure the

639
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,440
shape of it

640
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,760
uh that's that blue layer across the top

641
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,679
is

642
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,840
is public in industry uh the yellow in

643
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,880
the middle is is omg membership and then

644
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,360
teal at the bottom is is uh the results

645
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,760
of our

646
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,080
our processes through the organization

647
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,279
so market becomes aware of a problem

648
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,080
um they can come to us as an

649
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,640
organization

650
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,080
and we will help them find a task force

651
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,400
that is dedicated to that

652
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,520
domain or that platform technology

653
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,039
somewhere that it fits

654
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,480
makes sense that they have access to

655
00:25:53,039 --> 00:26:00,080
experts and the task force will form

656
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,400
uh questions about that particular

657
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,799
problem space and try and find out more

658
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,960
and then they will publish an rfi

659
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,640
request for information

660
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,880
that rfi then goes back out into

661
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,880
industry and at this point we're like

662
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,559
okay we we have an idea of what the

663
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,520
problem looks like

664
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,880
but we need to we need to you know

665
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
gather more information

666
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,799
and start to form the shape of a

667
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,520
solution

668
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,840
so we go out the rfi goes out the public

669
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,840
anybody in in the world can respond to

670
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,600
an rfi and we encourage that

671
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,200
as much as possible we want to get

672
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,240
everybody involved in the conversation

673
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,760
get as much information as we can so the

674
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,760
industry responses are gathered they

675
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,600
come back to the task force

676
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,600
the task force then uses that

677
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,880
information to help hammer out a set of

678
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,760
requirements

679
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,520
in other words what is the what is the

680
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,799
solution going to have to look like in

681
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,320
this problem space

682
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,640
what is it going to have to address

683
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,600
explicitly and concretely

684
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,480
and the task force uh defines those

685
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,600
requirements

686
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,600
and then authors an rfp or request for

687
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,000
proposals

688
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
that then goes back out into industry

689
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,559
and that's where i think a lot of people

690
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,919
start to hear about uh omg processes is

691
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,159
probably at the rfp

692
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,200
stage but there's a there's that entire

693
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,919
early section

694
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,520
of the conversation where we really

695
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,320
encourage people to get involved because

696
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,080
they get to help

697
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,000
shape not just the solution but the

698
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,200
shape of the problem

699
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,840
and you know as system engineers you

700
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,880
know

701
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,919
that uh defining the problem is often a

702
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,200
major part of this

703
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,360
of defining the solution so it's

704
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,480
it's this back and forth between you

705
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,200
know these three different

706
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,799
uh these three different groups of the

707
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,919
public the task forces

708
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,240
and the organization um but yeah that's

709
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,480
uh

710
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,360
the rfi and the rfp the rfp goes out

711
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,880
into

712
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,440
into the public um anybody can

713
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,399
at that point say that they have a an

714
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,039
intent

715
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,679
to contribute intellectual property or

716
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,640
so or

717
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,440
a solution towards a specification and

718
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,919
that's where we

719
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
gather what we call letters of intent

720
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,679
very

721
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,559
you know obviously named um anybody in

722
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,159
the world can

723
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,320
file a letter of intent it's not a

724
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,840
contract it's simply a you know raising

725
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,279
your hand and saying hey we

726
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,559
we think we'd like to help out on this

727
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,000
at that point the those who have filed

728
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,039
letters of intent

729
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,480
uh conform into submission teams

730
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,760
and this is where sysml v2 is right now

731
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,760
is that submission team works together

732
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,960
outside of the omg processes this is

733
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,720
their own private

734
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,880
their own private doing uh they

735
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
work together to try and form a solution

736
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,240
amongst themselves

737
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,120
and the wrinkle is that only omg members

738
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,360
can actually

739
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,559
formally submit a proposal which is why

740
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,120
that next box is

741
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,240
partially blue and partially yellow it's

742
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,640
uh

743
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,240
you don't have to be an omg member to be

744
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,080
part of the submission team but you must

745
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,880
be an omg member as a company to

746
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,480
actually

747
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,799
submit the specification proposal into

748
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,919
the

749
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,600
omg processes um you know have your

750
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,200
your company on the copyright and all

751
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,840
that good stuff

752
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,679
so there's a there's also a

753
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,159
being an omg member in that capacity

754
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,159
also gives you a tremendous voice

755
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,279
in what happens to the specification

756
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,919
later on the process

757
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,840
that you don't have if you are simply a

758
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,720
member of the submission team

759
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,480
so proposals come in they go to the task

760
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,640
force that issue the rfp

761
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,440
the task force evaluates the submission

762
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,159
or submissions if they get more than one

763
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,720
and they oversee the authoring of a

764
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,399
final

765
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,360
specification that specification

766
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,200
is now put out in sort of a beta testing

767
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,799
format

768
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,600
we call it a beta specification for a

769
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,360
reason uh it goes out into the public

770
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,279
anybody can download it they can kick

771
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,399
the tires they can test it out

772
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,600
and they provide feedback to

773
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,080
us to what is called a finalization task

774
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,520
force

775
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,440
or an ftf and that ftf

776
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,120
takes the issues that are filed we use

777
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,399
we use jira as a

778
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,919
tracking system and they address

779
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,360
each and every issue that comes in

780
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,720
they're not allowed to just ignore

781
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,679
things

782
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,240
it must be reconciled in one way or

783
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,120
another

784
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,399
even if the reconciliation is deferred

785
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
we're not going to do this right now

786
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,279
we'll do it later

787
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,760
but each and every issue that comes in

788
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,559
from the public must be addressed

789
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,679
and at that point we have a o

790
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,440
specification

791
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,640
we've got a 1.0 a 2.0 um

792
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,880
and it goes back as a formally

793
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,840
published specification of the omg now

794
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,960
it's out there for people

795
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,440
to download uh to implement to adopt in

796
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,320
their industry

797
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,679
but we're not done because there's

798
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,399
always the chance that there may be a

799
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,120
bug

800
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,880
so we want to make sure it's a stable

801
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,039
solution moving forward

802
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,880
and that's where the revision task force

803
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,640
is chartered it's an rtf

804
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,480
uh for short and it acts much like the

805
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,519
finalization task force but in an

806
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:23,360
ongoing basis so we'll have a 1.1 rtf

807
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,559
a 1.2 rtf etc etc as the specification

808
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,320
evolves through time

809
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,039
we make sure that there's always a group

810
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,120
that is ready and willing to

811
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,720
receive and accept and address any

812
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,360
issues that are found

813
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,240
and that bumps up the the minor version

814
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,240
number

815
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,360
at which point it goes right back into

816
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,640
the next rtf

817
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,679
so this is a this is an ongoing

818
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,840
discussion what's the problem what's the

819
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,720
solution is it suitable is it robust and

820
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,320
is it stable

821
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,880
and at some point in time we usually

822
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,320
realize that we can do more or industry

823
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,080
comes to us and says you know what we

824
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,600
think we can do more

825
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,360
and we start the whole process over

826
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,799
again um

827
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:08,159
but it's uh you end up with a 2.0

828
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,039
3.0 etc so this is the this is the

829
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,559
overall

830
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,159
general view of of uh the evolution of

831
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,519
the specification and i am hand

832
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,120
waving away every single omg process in

833
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,720
this because those all happen between

834
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,679
the gold and the teal down there at the

835
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,919
bottom

836
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,919
um

837
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,240
there's a ton there as well but

838
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,880
i will stop there unless you guys want

839
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
me to continue

840
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,840
are there any timing constraints so um

841
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,679
between an rfi and rfp there must be at

842
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,240
maximum only one year or something like

843
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,600
that

844
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,279
there are there are there are

845
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,240
constraints we have the

846
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,840
the infamous pnp policies and procedures

847
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,000
document which outlines

848
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,919
the entire timeline everything from

849
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,120
uh you know an rfi should have a

850
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,080
guideline of

851
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,679
uh six to 12 months to give companies

852
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,679
sufficient time to respond

853
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,760
one thing that a lot of people forget is

854
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,840
that companies also need to

855
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,159
have their uh their legal department

856
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,559
usually sign off on their response

857
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,000
and that tends to be the biggest the the

858
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,399
biggest delay that we see

859
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,440
so uh when you have engineers in the

860
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,799
room and they're like oh yeah

861
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,360
we'll give them three months it'll be

862
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,640
fine no no no no

863
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,120
the engineers will be ready in three

864
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,159
months legal department may take longer

865
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,679
so uh we try to say you know

866
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,039
nine to 12 months for an rfi um the rfp

867
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,240
when it goes out

868
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,120
uh the absolute shortest time that you

869
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,440
can do

870
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,600
is six months it's possible

871
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,120
um you have to really put your ducks in

872
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,679
a row and make sure that everything is

873
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,519
lined up

874
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,720
exactly right because the deadlines

875
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,919
are uh very firm and

876
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,919
they center around our conferences um

877
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,919
and the conferences while they are every

878
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,279
three months they are not

879
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,560
exactly every 91 and a quarter days

880
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,399
so um sometimes there's a

881
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,639
there's a you know there'll be a week

882
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,280
earlier or a week later than expected

883
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,240
and uh that can cause some issues but

884
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,520
for the most part

885
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,320
we uh yeah it's we try and make sure

886
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,079
that uh

887
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,320
everything goes out with sufficient time

888
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,359
such that folks in public and industry

889
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,839
have plenty of time to

890
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,760
gather their thoughts put together a

891
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,800
solution or a response

892
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,919
and uh get it back to us in

893
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,200
with uh copious amounts of time

894
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,679
what's the longest time between rfp and

895
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,359
the submission for example system will

896
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,639
be two the rfp was december 2017

897
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,679
right so three years ago but it's still

898
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,240
running

899
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,919
it yeah it can it can it can still run

900
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,960
the um

901
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,400
when it comes to you know small very

902
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,040
focused specifications

903
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,280
um we've done it in as little as 18

904
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,839
months from beginning to end

905
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
from issuance of an rfp all the way to

906
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,320
the final adoption

907
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,400
of an ftf 18 months which is

908
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,520
fast uh when we know that it's going to

909
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,640
be an exceedingly

910
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,079
large complicated uh

911
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,200
specification lexus mlv2 um then yes

912
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,720
it's it's just basically make sure that

913
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,359
everybody has the time that they need

914
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,000
one of the nice things is that once you

915
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,000
get past

916
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,320
the initial submission stage and that

917
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,320
submission goes into the final in sorry

918
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,760
into the task force

919
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,920
for review uh there you enter the

920
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,400
revised submission stage and that's

921
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,119
where

922
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,320
everything gets hammered out that can

923
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,240
actually be

924
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
shortened at any time that the task

925
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,119
force says yep

926
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,960
we're done we gave ourselves a year but

927
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,680
we did it in three months we're done

928
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,359
they can move forward so we have some

929
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,480
flexibility built in but

930
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,680
yes it can be a very fast or a very long

931
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,760
process

932
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,079
depending on the complexity of the

933
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,599
solution that's being hammered out

934
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,520
okay so for

935
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,560
our live watchers you can also use

936
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,599
uh the chat the live chat and

937
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,640
ask some questions that we will refer to

938
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,280
jason uh if you have some

939
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,400
and in the meantime i would have another

940
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,880
question

941
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,960
so let's assume i'm not a member my

942
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,640
company my employer is not a member but

943
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,240
i want to check that out

944
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,900
can i just sign up for a meeting and

945
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,520
how can i do the the omg experience

946
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,640
[Laughter]

947
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,960
well the omg experience wow that's

948
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,960
that's

949
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,599
for those of you who haven't been to

950
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,440
conferences it is um

951
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,839
it's nine in the morning to five at

952
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,119
night of extremely intense

953
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,480
technical work lots of discussion uh

954
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,599
argument it's it's lively it's

955
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,400
it's very serious and in the evenings

956
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,400
it's not

957
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,280
it's an incredible and incredible

958
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,640
experience um but yeah if anybody wants

959
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,680
to get involved

960
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,640
uh a couple of ways first of all that

961
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,960
entire blue track across the top of the

962
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,240
uh the prior slide responding to our rfi

963
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,400
getting involved with the submission

964
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,400
team uh hammering out

965
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,839
you know issues on a specification and

966
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,760
filing issues with us

967
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,440
all of that anyone can do at any time

968
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,160
that is completely open to the public

969
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,240
you can be

970
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,040
part of the conversation through that

971
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,800
route if you want to come to the omg

972
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,320
uh there's a couple of different ways

973
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,720
you can do it

974
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,079
one is wait a couple of different ways

975
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,320
you can do it without becoming a full

976
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,200
member let me move it that way

977
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,040
we frequently have what we call meet and

978
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,480
greets and these are usually domain

979
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,440
focused mini conferences that happen

980
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,280
during our regular

981
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,880
technical committee meetings they'll

982
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,200
usually happen in the evening

983
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,200
and we will have guest speakers and it's

984
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,359
a way to come and find out what

985
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,480
a what omg is doing on a particular

986
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:22,000
topic or in a particular domain

987
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,599
it's a great networking opportunity

988
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,640
they're low-cost they are exceedingly

989
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,560
lively

990
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,839
and it's just a lot of fun it's a great

991
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,760
way to kind of get your feet wet

992
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,359
um sometimes uh we

993
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,480
we will offer i don't want to make any

994
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:41,359
promises sometimes we will offer uh

995
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,800
folks a guest pass for a day or two if

996
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,599
there's a particular meeting that they

997
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,280
really would like to sit on on

998
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,359
they of course don't have any voting

999
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,480
power in those meetings

1000
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,920
um but uh yeah they can come see what

1001
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,760
it's all about and uh try and decide

1002
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,520
you know what level of interaction they

1003
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,880
would like to get

1004
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,160
but of course there's also become a

1005
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,760
member and when you become a member

1006
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,079
they you have a voice with an omg you

1007
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,880
have

1008
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,760
an official vote and we have kind of an

1009
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,079
interesting

1010
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:19,359
and unique feature of omg and that is

1011
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,400
it's one vote per company not

1012
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:26,079
one vote per person which means

1013
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,560
that ibm and microsoft have exactly the

1014
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,520
same

1015
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,160
amount of official voting power as a

1016
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,200
one-person consultancy

1017
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,079
this is kind of unique for an sdo

1018
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,880
normally it's normally it's uh it's done

1019
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,359
on a per

1020
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,640
representative basis and we do it on a

1021
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,599
per company basis

1022
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,400
and we feel that this really helps

1023
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,000
elevate

1024
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,320
the voices of uh individuals

1025
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,520
um from smaller companies who may

1026
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,200
otherwise not get an

1027
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,400
opportunity to be heard in a larger

1028
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,160
environment

1029
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,860
so this is it's it's a

1030
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,800
it's a feature not a bug

1031
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:10,000
[Laughter]

1032
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,560
we're really proud of that a little bit

1033
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,880
uh you said that omg is a member driven

1034
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,359
organization so all the specification

1035
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,240
work

1036
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,640
is done by the members and i think

1037
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,079
that's

1038
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,280
that's an interesting point because the

1039
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,119
members do not get any money for that

1040
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,200
well it's vice versa they must pay for

1041
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,560
that they can work for the obj so to say

1042
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,680
um and well they have to spend a lot of

1043
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,920
time

1044
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,680
um in the specification work i think

1045
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,760
because most of them

1046
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,680
do this because it's it's their passion

1047
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,720
and life blood so

1048
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,200
um but are there other ways to

1049
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,480
to keep this process running so that

1050
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,640
that

1051
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,480
they work on standards like like system

1052
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,079
lv2 which is a very complex one that's

1053
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,520
able that the people

1054
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,560
work in their spare time in most cases

1055
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,319
uh for for some years on understand that

1056
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,240
so

1057
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,599
but yeah thanks what attracts people

1058
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,240
well i think it's like you said it's

1059
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,720
passion it's these are

1060
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,560
these are members all individuals who

1061
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,160
are here because they want to be

1062
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,440
and because they see the value of having

1063
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,319
uh specifications standards um

1064
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,880
they see the value of that because it's

1065
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,520
uh

1066
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,040
you know it it helps lay foundations for

1067
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,240
innovation later

1068
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,240
uh if you know everybody had to choose

1069
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,839
their you know their appliances based on

1070
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,359
the electrical plugs they had in their

1071
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,760
house based on the plug

1072
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,440
vendor that the house builder selected

1073
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,560
when it was originally built it would be

1074
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,920
insane

1075
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,280
but we have standardized plugs and

1076
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,240
it makes things easier so people come

1077
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,440
here because

1078
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,119
they see specific problems that they

1079
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,680
would pretty much like to get out of the

1080
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,160
way and for their industry

1081
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,760
and say we would love to stop spending

1082
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,040
time on this particular problem

1083
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,040
everybody's beating their head against

1084
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,760
this wall let's just get together

1085
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,480
solve it once and for all and move on to

1086
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,680
the next

1087
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,720
thing because that's the fun part

1088
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,280
so it's it is it's people who are

1089
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,079
passionate

1090
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,200
about not only uh working on the

1091
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,240
specific problems

1092
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,640
that come to us at omg but because they

1093
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,640
want to get to what's next

1094
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,079
they want to get to the next interesting

1095
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,359
thing um

1096
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,480
and that's a i think it's a passion that

1097
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,800
everybody there shares yeah

1098
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,319
yeah there's always a special energy

1099
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,359
there the meeting so i think it's

1100
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,359
absolutely earliest

1101
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,680
it really is it's uh it's always a bit

1102
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,280
hopeful

1103
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,040
and uh um yeah i really miss the

1104
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,400
face-to-face meetings right now

1105
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,960
yeah yeah i agree so i would like to

1106
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,119
come

1107
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,079
back to the point or tim do you have an

1108
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,839
additional question

1109
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,200
maybe one last question about about the

1110
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,520
members

1111
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,240
sometimes people say omg stands for old

1112
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,800
man group so

1113
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,000
there are many old people maybe i'm also

1114
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,400
one of them so

1115
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,720
but is it real is

1116
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,400
most members of or persons at the omg

1117
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,079
meetings or in the groups are

1118
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,839
old or is it not true anymore

1119
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,760
um i would say it's getting less true

1120
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,880
thankfully the uh

1121
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,920
but yeah it's it's been

1122
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,720
it's been an issue because

1123
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,720
the folks who generally have the most

1124
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,079
expertise in the industry to see the

1125
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,280
large-scale problems

1126
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,359
and to see the possibilities of those

1127
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,400
large-scale solutions do tend to be

1128
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,680
those who have

1129
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,079
more years in the industry they do tend

1130
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,240
to be

1131
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:51,200
skew a little bit older and um

1132
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,640
that's it's great when it is a you know

1133
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:58,800
a base of expertise and a base of

1134
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:02,000
wisdom for lack of a better word but

1135
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,200
we absolutely are reaching out and

1136
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,240
making sure that we

1137
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,119
continue to have folks come in from

1138
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,079
younger

1139
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,400
and younger demographics because there

1140
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,200
is

1141
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,160
no there's no age restriction on

1142
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,760
innovation

1143
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,520
and there's no age restriction on uh

1144
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,880
solving problems and being part of this

1145
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,800
conversation

1146
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,480
so we're you know we encourage everybody

1147
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,119
to come be a part of the conversation is

1148
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,240
really the

1149
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,319
the easiest way to put it um there's

1150
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,000
uh there's a space here for pretty much

1151
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,839
anybody and everybody

1152
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,359
and the folks who are a little bit older

1153
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:42,079
love to mentor so

1154
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,119
it's a it's a fantastic opportunity for

1155
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,480
folks who may be

1156
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,040
earlier in their careers to come

1157
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,000
get first-hand advice and first-hand

1158
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,880
knowledge from folks

1159
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,520
who have who have been there and seen

1160
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,440
that

1161
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,640
so it's it's a fantastic place for

1162
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,480
everyone

1163
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,480
so one way to attract younger people

1164
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,760
would be to include academia and

1165
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,119
universities

1166
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,440
so is there a special program for them

1167
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,119
actually there is uh we have our

1168
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,319
academia working group which is always

1169
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,040
looking for ways to do

1170
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,359
outreach uh we also have a special

1171
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,560
membership level for our universities

1172
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,119
and uh it's one membership again since

1173
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,839
we do

1174
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,280
one membership per company uh one

1175
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,400
membership and i believe

1176
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,079
it is a whopping sum of five hundred

1177
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,040
dollars u.s

1178
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,920
covers the entire university all faculty

1179
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,560
all staff and all students

1180
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,760
so anyone who wishes to come in under a

1181
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,040
university banner

1182
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:44,160
that's a fantastic way to do it we work

1183
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,760
with a number of graduate departments

1184
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,520
and we have just started actually

1185
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,280
we announced it right before everything

1186
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,160
shut down so our timing was

1187
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,359
excellent uh we are starting poster

1188
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,720
sessions

1189
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:01,760
where we are inviting uh hopefully

1190
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,400
um universities around the areas that we

1191
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,920
are going to be physically located at

1192
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,119
uh to work with us and help get their

1193
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,960
graduate students and their

1194
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,680

but uh yeah that academic outreach is is

1212
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,800
something we

1213
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,400
we're feeling uh rather strongly about

1214
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,640
and uh we think it has a

1215
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,040
tremendous amount of opportunity for us

1216
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,040
okay

1217
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,920
and we have a question from the audience

1218
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,880
dominic

1219
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,880
asks can national agencies be members of

1220
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,400
omg and if yes

1221
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,359
are are conflicts of national interests

1222
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,560
ever be a problem in technical meetings

1223
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,359
oh good one uh yes national agencies can

1224
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,319
be

1225
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,960
uh can be omg members in fact we have a

1226
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,839
government

1227
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,839
level for exactly that purpose

1228
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,400
i don't think that we've ever had a

1229
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,319
conflict of interest

1230
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,160
bubble up and be exposed without our

1231
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,160
environment

1232
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,280
the folks who come from government are

1233
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,920
all

1234
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,640
you know professional exceptional at uh

1235
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,319
making sure

1236
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,599
that uh what goes on uh what they bring

1237
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:49,680
to our environment

1238
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,720
is is appropriate um

1239
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,480
no i'm trying to think i don't think

1240
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,000
we've had a conflict of interest of that

1241
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,280
particular kind

1242
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,480
uh it's we're we're not

1243
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,319
a because we're not a standards

1244
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,599
development organization we don't have

1245
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:08,079
nations as our our members

1246
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,319
so we don't have to have to worry about

1247
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,440
particular you know issues around that

1248
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,720
um but yeah we have member nist

1249
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,640
national institute of standards and

1250
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:21,599
technologies here in the us

1251
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:24,160
is one of our members i believe that the

1252
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,440
well i'll just stop exposing my

1253
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,119
ignorance and instead say

1254
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,480
nist yes we actually absolutely have

1255
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:33,200
never and i know that we have others

1256
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:36,400
as well so what membership level is jpl

1257
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,880
is it governmental or is it oh good

1258
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,319
question

1259
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,400
i honestly don't know i'd have to look

1260
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,400
that up let's look that up

1261
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,960
yeah tim other questions i

1262
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,839
don't have any more questions

1263
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,040
so i i would have one little question i

1264
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:57,040
would like to come

1265
00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:00,319
back to the small companies and

1266
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:03,680
the the individuals

1267
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:06,000
self-employed people um

1268
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,599
isn't that too expensive for them or how

1269
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,240
how do you

1270
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,800
do you do you have different membership

1271
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,319
levels

1272
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,480
and how do you manage that

1273
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,920
we do actually now that thank you for

1274
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,520
asking that that's a good point

1275
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,119
the because one of the things that we

1276
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,000
like that we feel strongly about is

1277
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,359
elevating

1278
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,800
uh smaller voices um we have

1279
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:31,839
uh different tiers of membership level

1280
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,240
uh everything from contributing which is

1281
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,119
our

1282
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,880
sort of all-in-one package you can it's

1283
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,680
the the highest level

1284
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,680
uh you can vote in and contribute

1285
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,680
intellectual property to any task force

1286
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,079
at any moment at any time join any

1287
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,720
voting

1288
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:49,359
list it's really the the you know all

1289
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,160
you can eat buffet

1290
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,119
um we have that down to what we call

1291
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,839
observer

1292
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,040
which is you can come to the meetings uh

1293
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,319
you're welcome to be part of the

1294
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,760
conversation

1295
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,920
um however you cannot you cannot submit

1296
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,200
intellectual property to a specification

1297
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,599
and you cannot

1298
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,960
vote um but you can still be part of the

1299
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,200
conversation

1300
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,520
which is where a lot of people start so

1301
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:18,160
we have everything in between

1302
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:20,880
and we also scale our membership levels

1303
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,640
based on the revenue of the company so

1304
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,440
if it is a small company and you would

1305
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,200
like to come in

1306
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,800
at say observer that's a very small feat

1307
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,880
if you're a very large company and you

1308
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,440
would like to come in at contributing

1309
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,040
that's a much larger fee but we try and

1310
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,240
scale it to the

1311
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:42,240
the size and the uh the abilities

1312
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:44,960
of the of the member company coming in

1313
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,960

1314
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,760
so i see no more questions on the live

1315
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,960
chat

1316
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,839
i have no questions anymore tim

1317
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,440
still no questions no we are already 50

1318
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,800
minutes on the line so

1319
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,520
correct time is running

1320
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,520
times are running and i hope we could

1321
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,280
give our listeners a good insight
